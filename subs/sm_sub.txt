1545
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:07,527
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1546
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,272
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?

1547
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:14,238
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

What if somebody had died tonight?

1550
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,709
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.

1551
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,210
And if you died...

1552
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,588
...I feel like that's on me.

1553

- Yes, sir.

- Sorry doesn't cut it.

- Please, this is all I have.

I'm nothing without this suit.

1562
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:51,359
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.

1563
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:52,693

I called Ned's mother.

I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1577

I know you left detention.

- What?
- Yeah.

1585
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,005
What happened?

1586
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:02,642
I just thought that I could work really
hard and he could... He would... You know.

- Yeah.

01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,162

You smell.

1596

Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

2019
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:15,732
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?

01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,196
The dance?

2021
01:55:19,538 --> 01:55:22,281
That, um, was a pretty
crappy thing to do.

2022
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:23,788
Well, yeah, but I...

2023
01:55:23,959 --> 01:55:26,793
I mean, your dad... I can't imagine
what you're going through.

2024
01:55:26,962 --> 01:55:29,124
If there's anything
I can do to help...

2025

I guess we're moving to Oregon.

so that's cool.

Anyways, Dad doesn't want us
here during the trial. So...

Liz, I... I...

2029
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:46,141
Bye, Peter.

I hope you figure it out.

Congratulations,

- Yeah!
- Ha-ha.

2033
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:11,375
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...

have any friends.
