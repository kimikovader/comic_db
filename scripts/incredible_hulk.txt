MANAGER
I keep telling you... let me put you on
payroll. I can pay you what you’re worth!
BANNER
You can say that again.
KID
Mom, I need a napkin!!
KID
Mom?
KID
MoM!!!
CABOT
... and here’s something a little more
interesting.
CABOT
Possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.
Woman drank one of these guarana sodas.
Had more kick than she was looking for.
ROSS
Last three were irradiated fruit, not
Gamma... 
CABOT
Look at the spectrograph in that path
report.  Even the FDA didn’t approve
that.  Whatever it was it was
concentrated. Got less than a tenth of a
milliliter and it almost killed her.
ROSS
Get it confirmed.
CABOT
Already put calls in.
ROSS
Where was it bottled?
CABOT
Porto Verde, Brazil... 
ROSS
Remember that package we tracked to the
girl that just had a pressed orchid in
it? Year and half ago maybe... ?
CABOT
It came from Sao Paolo.
ROSS
Get our Agency people looking for a white
man at that bottling plant.  Tell them no
contact, if he even sees them he’s gone.
And get me Sam Greller!
COMMANDO 1
Who’s our 6?
COMMANDO 2
Blonsky.
COMMANDO 1
Thought he was on vacation?
COMMANDO 2
He got bored. Volunteered.
ROSS
... I know you cashed some chips for this,
Sam.  I’m grateful.
GRELLER
Glad to do it. Just make it good.
COMMANDO 1
Since when do they fob us off to
Logistics officers?
COMMANDO 2
Ain’t exactly feeling A-Team is it?
CABOT
This is the target and the location.
Insert and grab only, live capture.
You’ll have tranq rifles and suppression
ordnance. Live fire for backup only.
We’ve got help from local but we want it
tight and quiet.
COMMANDO 1
Little excitement, huh Major?
CABOT
How’s that?
COMMANDO 1
Got tired of pushing paper around?
CABOT
I worked intel for 3rd I.D. on the way in
to Baghdad my first tour. I got bumped to
you Rangers in time for Falluja.  Says
here me and Blonsky got our Purple Hearts
same week. So, no, I’d very much like to
get back to my office, thanks.
CABOT
Only way this’ll get exciting is if you
guys screw it up. Any more questions?
BLONSKY
Is he a fighter?
ROSS
Your target is a fugitive from the US
government and stole military secrets. He
is implicated in the deaths of three
scientists, a military officer, an Idaho
State trooper and possibly two Canadian
hunters. Don’t wait to see if he’s a
fighter.  Put him to sleep.
ROSS
Each two man team will be issued a
radiation sensor which we will monitor
remotely as well. First blip I want to
know about it.
COMMANDO 2
This guy steal plutonium?
ROSS
Something like that. That’s all.
COMMANDO 1
Vietnam?
COMMANDO 3
I heard he ran R&D, real black box shit.
One of his experiments blew up in his
face, literally.  They gave him a desk to
run.
CABOT
Blonsky’s your point man.
TOUGH LEADER
Why do you act so shy? It’s not a sin to
have some fun in life... 
TOUGH LEADER
What are you, too good for us?
BANNER
Everything good?
TOUGH LEADER
Dump your load and get lost, mule. We’re
talking.
BANNER
You want some coffee, Martina? With me?
TOUGH LEADER
I said beat it, you want a problem?
BANNER
No problem... 
TOUGH LEADER
Too late... 
BANNER
Okay listen...  don’t make hungry...  you
wouldn’t like me when I’m... 
BANNER
... no wait... that’s not right...  ah shit.
MANAGER
HEY!!  Cut it out! I got supply sitting
here collecting bugs! You want me to hire
somebody else to move it!  NOW!!
VOICE
Clear.
ROSS
Geiger?
ROSS
Take him.
BLONSKY
Target’s on the move.
BLONSKY
He’s on the ground, going rear.
CABOT
Leader we’re at your two-o’clock, team
coming from your nine. Got him boxed.
Three more moves. Game over.
CABOT
Okay... Past mobile unit now and heading
oh-nine-zero.
BLONSKY
Target acquired.
BANNER
Please... don’t do this.
TOUGH LEADER
What? I can’t understand you. No fight?
Not so tough now, huh? Try those fancy
moves again. Come on, we all want to see.
BANNER
Stop. Please stop. Me. Angry. Very bad.
TOUGH LEADER
You bad angry, son? I VERY BAD ANGRY!
BANNER
Let me go! You don’t understand.
Something really bad is going happen
here!!
TOUGH LEADER
Yeah, something bad is going to happen.
TOUGH GUY
What the hell... ?
CABOT
Is target neutral? Did we get a shot?
TOUGH LEADER
SHuT UP!!!
CABOT
Where’s the target?
ROSS
That is the target, goddam it, now take
it out!!
ROSS
Don’t let him out of the building! Put
all your tranqs in him! Every one you’ve
got! Do it now!!
COMMANDO 1
Holy SHIT! GO LIVE! GO LIV--
CABOT
Sir, no!!
CABOT
The stuff in the bottles was basic lab
chemicals. Zero intel. Like he knew we
were coming and cleaned the place. Not a
scrap of paper.
BLONSKY
Saw he had it on the run, but it was gone
right before I got the shot off...  found
it under the machine that our guys got
hit with.
BLONSKY
Girlfriend? Maybe she helps him... 
ROSS
No, we closed that door to him a long
time ago.
BLONSKY
Sir, with all respect... Does somebody
want to tell me just what the hell went
down in there? What was that thing?
CABOT
There’s rumors in the street about
sightings... farmer says he saw a gorilla
going into the edge of the forest.
BLONSKY
That was no gorilla. It was 10 feet tall
and green... or gray. I couldn’t tell. But
it wasn’t an animal and you can’t tell me
that thing is hiding somewhere.
ROSS
Two thousand miles of jungle to hide in.
He’s gone.
BLONSKY
What about Banner?
CABOT
Local PD’s on alert. He must have got out
when that Thing attacked us... 
ROSS
That was Banner.
CABOT
You think he led us into it?
ROSS
No I mean It... was Banner. It wasn’t an
animal, it was him.
BLONSKY
You’re going to have to explain that
statement.
ROSS
No, I’m not.  You did your jobs well,
both of you. We were undermanned and
that’s my fault.

ROSS
I didn’t think it would happen again... 
Pack up and get our men on the plane.
We’re going home.
BANNER
Can you help me?
TRUCKER
No habla Portuguese.
BANNER
Where..? Donde... donde estoy?
TRUCKER
Paroma.  Paraguay?  Brazil es ayi... 
Ochenta kilometers.
BANNER
Mas grande.
CABOT
He’s tight, this one. No names, all
authors names deleted. He was using a
randomizer to tap different wireless
networks every time he went online.  We
can’t even trace where his email went or
where it came from.
ROSS
He’s trying to get rid of it.
CABOT
We’ll have the Agency people down here
keep their radar up.
ROSS
It doesn’t matter. He’s already on the
move.
GRELLER
You wanna tell me that one more time?
ROSS
Do I look like I’m not being serious,
Sam?
GRELLER
T., I’ve known you a long time and I’ve
never seen a cooler head under fire.

GRELLER
I know something bit you in the ass down
there, but that is one hell of a White
Whale story. And I am way out on a limb
with you on this already.
ROSS
Ask Blonsky.
BLONSKY
... yes, sir. I’d say ten or eleven feet.
I’d put him at 1500 pounds easily but
could be more. And green.  Or gray.
Greenish gray. It was very dark.
three clips on it, sir and didn’t even
flinch. I didn’t miss, I’ll stake my
medals on that.
GRELLER
Captain, is there a medal you haven’t
won?
BLONSKY
Medal of Honor, sir. A high percentage
are given posthumously of course.
GRELLER
Relax, will you Blonsky?  T., you wanna
tell me what the hell you think is really
going on here?
ROSS
Banner’s work was a tangent of Bio-Tech.
GRELLER
You told me you were going to Brazil to
nab a scientist. Are you telling me one
of your Super Soldier experiments got out
of the box?
ROSS
I’m telling you that this could be an
incredibly dangerous weapon in the wrong
hands and we have no idea what his
intentions are.
GRELLER
Put together a new list.
BLONSKY
Are you telling me he becomes that thing
at will?
ROSS
I don’t have an answer to that, soldier.
BLONSKY
Greller said “Super Soldier”. Do you mind
if I ask... 
ROSS
Yes, I mind.  You’re asking questions way
above your paygrade, Captain.
BLONSKY
Respectfully sir, I lost two men back
there who had made it through some bad
shit with me. One was on his way out to
have a family. I’d just like to know what
we got mixed up in.
ROSS
You hungry?
ROSS
... do appreciate your professionalism but
let me emphasize that what I’m about to
share with you is tremendously sensitive
to both me personally and the Army.
ROSS
I’m sure you’re aware that we’ve got an
Infantry Weapons Development
program... within it however we ran a
subprogram for Bio-Tech Force
Enhancement.
BLONSKY
Super Soldier.
ROSS
Yes... an oversimplification... but yes.
Across the hall they’re trying to arm you
better, we were trying to make you
better. In all the obvious ways and some
not so obvious. Banner’s work was very
early phase, it wasn’t even a weapons
application. It was radiation mitigation,
see if we could give our boys built in
insulation against all that depleted
uranium nobody likes talking about.  It
was promising but politicians don’t give
a Flying F about what real soldiers need,
they like big twin rotor heli-planes that
don’t work that they can build in their
states...  and so our money was running
out. Banner was so sure of what he was on
to that he tested it on himself. It was
supposed to be very low-exposure and
something went wrong. Or went very
right...  I still don’t know.
BLONSKY
Why did he rabbit on you?
ROSS
Banner was brilliant, one in a
generation... but he is scientist, not one
of us. He doesn’t grasp that to have
peace and freedom you need Power.  That
people like you and I need instruments to
do what we do.
BLONSKY
So it’d be good to nail him sure, but why
not just take the data to someone else?
ROSS
Because he IS the data. As far as I’m
concerned, that man’s whole body is
property of the US Army.
BLONSKY
I have real contempt for people like
that.
ROSS
You and me both, Captain. You and me
both.
BLONSKY
What about the rest of it? You tried
other things?
ROSS
It was very promising but none of it
panned out.  Or, it did but it
was... unstable.  Made the subjects
unstable. I wanted to refine it.. but
then Al-Haquid happened and Congress
killed it. No stomach.
BLONSKY
You’ll need something special to go
against that thing. Someone who can
survive to learn how to fight it. I’d be
willing.
ROSS
Blonsky, how old are you? 40?
BLONSKY
37.
ROSS
Why are you still a Captain? You should
be a full Colonel with your record. Shit
you could be a Senator! Take your pick.
Get out of the trench.
BLONSKY
I don’t want to lead. I’m a fighter.
That’s all I want to be and I want to be
the best for as long as I can and I don’t
want to lose a step and if there’s
something I can take to give me an edge,
I want it.
ROSS
Well, I’m glad to see that all that
advertising we do actually works. You
know when I came back from Vietnam I was
27. I looked 45. So you’re beating the
curve.  But it takes a toll doesn’t it?
BLONSKY
Yes it does.
MEDICAL TECH
You’ll get two separate infusions,
dripped in very slowly. One into the deep
muscle, one into bone marrow centers.
The bone ones are going to hurt.
ROSS
We’re giving you a very low dose only. I
need you sharp out there, disciplined.
First side of any side effect and we stop
and you’re off team until you straighten
out. Agreed?
STAN
... so many rumors. People say the worst
things without any idea what they’re
saying.
BANNER
Stan, I promise you, whatever you’ve
heard about me isn’t true.
STAN
I know it.  I know people and I always
knew it. But you know how I felt about
you two...  Have you talked to... ?
BANNER
No. She’s with
STAN
Samson.  Yeah, you heard.  He’s a head
shrink. They say one of the best. But a
good guy. Take my word. Reminds me of you
a lit-- Sorry. Bruce, what can I do to
help you?
BANNER
I could use a place to stay a few nights.
STAN
You’ll stay in the spare room upstairs.
Use the back, nobody’ll see you come or
go.
BANNER
Great. One other thing... can I deliver a
few pizzas?
STAN
Deliver all you want, I’ll give Lou the
week off. But someday you gotta tell me
what all this was about.
BANNER
Stan, if I told you, you’d never believe
me.
CHICK
Thanks... 
BANNER
Ummm... sorry. That’s $46.50
CHICK
Oh... we have an account with Stanley. He
knows us...  We’re Theta.
BANNER
I can see that you are. Do you mind if we
call him?
CHICK
Yes, I mind... anyway it took forever and
now it’s cold.
CHICK
Oops. Sorry.
BANNER
You know, you shouldn’t make me angry.
You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry
CHICK
Whatever, pscycho.
KEG GUY
Dude, where are your balls? You can’t lay
down for that shit! You gotta smash that
door in and... 
BANNER
I got a delivery on 5.
GUARD
I don’t think anybody’s up there.
BANNER
Oh man, everybody’s bailing...  I already
got an medium with no takers.  You want
it?
GUARD
Don’t let me stand in the way of
commerce. God bless, brother.
BANNER
Those douches in radiation called this in
and then split.  You want it?
COMPUTER NERD
Whoever you are, you are my new personal
hero.
BANNER
Hey... you mind if I jump online for a
second?
COMPUTER NERD
Totally. You wanna join my Vice
City... ”Manolo, choot this piece of
chit.”
BANNER
Righteous. Gimme a sec.
BANNER
... gone.  All of it. Like it never
happened.
STAN
The whole building was closed for a year
after the explosion. Military guards... 
BANNER
I don’t know what I was thinking. There’s
nothing for me here. I don’t know why I
came... I hoped... 
STAN
What’ll you do now?
BANNER
I’ll go in the morning.
STAN
Where?
BANNER
It’s better if I don’t tell you, Stan.
STAN
I’m so sorry. I wish I could... 
BANNER
You did help me, Stan. You’ve got no idea
how nice it is just to see a friendly
face.
STAN
I’ll just get rid of em and we’ll have
some food... 
STAN
Kids! I got nothing but marinara now... 
BETTY
Oh, I need a Mr. Pink, Stan. Please!
SAMSON
She worked through dinner again.
BETTY
Not too spicy, Stan... 
STAN
I know how you like it... 
BETTY
BRuCE!
BRuCE
It’s alright... 
SAMSON
Betty!?
BETTY
When did... ? Are you... ?
BANNER
I’m alright. I’m so sorry, I didn’t want
to... 
SAMSON
Betty, what happened? Are you okay?
BETTY
Samson, this is
Banner.
SAMSON
Samson Adams.
BETTY
Can you... ?  There are just so many
things...  I can’t... 
SAMSON
We should get in out of the rain. We’re
just on our way home now.  Will you join
us?
BANNER
Yes... thanks, I’d like that.  I need
to... uh...  Tell me where and I’ll meet
you there in a few minutes.
SAMSON
39 Hillhouse.  On the corner of
Maple... by the old... 
BANNER
Yes I remember. Alright.
SAMSON
I’ll be here.
BETTY
Please don’t go away. Please. I need to
see you and talk to you.
BANNER
I want to... so much. But it’s not safe.
BETTY
I don’t care. Please. You can’t just
disappear again. I couldn’t take it.
BANNER
I don’t want to make things more
difficult for you. I couldn’t bear that.
BETTY
I want you to come with me now. He does
too.
SAMSON
Welcome.  Now both of you go get out of
those wet clothes. I think we all need
some hot food and a number of drinks.
You’re talking, I’m cooking.  Now go... 
BETTY
... and they just let you stay?
BANNER
I think it was novel at first, they don’t
get the spiritual tourism up there on the
Northern Plateau. And I’m good at fixing
things so...   It was peaceful. For a long
time that’s all I wanted.

BANNER
When I heard the rug dealer down in town
had gotten internet... my brain started
going and eventually I couldn’t resist.
That’s how I got to Sterns.
BETTY
And trimethodine... 
BANNER
I didn’t think you could synthesize an
inhibitor that complex but he has been. I
mean five years ago... 
BETTY
We’re all a lot further along than we
were then, but Sterns is way out in front
on that score. He had some kind of ethics
cloud around him at Cal Tech but it
didn’t stop him. His work is unbelievably
brilliant. So, Brazil for the corablanca?
BANNER
He’s synthesizing it but I had to try to
get it at the source.  It took a long
time just to get there. And I couldn’t
get a thousandth of what I’d need.  If
he’s even right... 
BETTY
And now?
BANNER
I go find him, I suppose. I don’t know if
he’s really got something and it’s a much
longer shot without the data but I’ve got
to risk it... 
BETTY
No, you don’t.
BETTY
I got in there before they carted it all
away.  I hoped it would tell us something
someday.
BANNER
Does the General know you have this?
BETTY
I don’t think so.
BANNER
He was there in Brazil. When they came
for me.  I saw him.
BETTY
Oh my god... he’s crazier than anybody
knows. I’m so sorry...  How?
BANNER
I’ve twisted it round every possible way.
Is there anyway it could have been
Sterns?
BETTY
I hear he’s a total anarchist. Hates
authority. Doesn’t think he should answer
to anybody. That’s why he got in trouble.
Bruce, why didn’t you... ?
SAMSON
I think we’re all set.
SAMSON
... and I said “Miss So-and-so, I’ve been
analyzing your ‘condition’ for nearly
three months and I think I can say
conclusively that your issues are more
Caffeinated-UnCaffeinated than Manic-
Depressive... 
BETTY
... You’re not so much Multiple
Personality as Spoiled Brat... 
BANNER
Your problem isn’t ADD so much as
laziness.
BETTY
It makes you sound cruel. But Samson
takes a few of these to pay for all the
free work he does.
SAMSON
Pro-whiners to pay for the pro-bono... 
BANNER
I’m so sorry. It’s been a long time since
I felt... light... about anything.
BETTY
It’s alright... you’re with friends.
BANNER
Good night.
SAMSON
Sleep well.
BETTY
Do you need anything?
BANNER
No. I should go early tomorrow. If I can
borrow cash from you, I’ll take the bus.
BETTY
Of course. I’ll drive you out to the
station.
BETTY
Thank you.
BANNER
Hey... 
SAMSON
Good lord, you scared me... 
SAMSON
I thought it might be easier for all of
us... Want some wine? I’m having a lot.
BANNER
You’re been incredibly generous. I’m very
sorry to have... dropped in like this.
SAMSON
I think I read a Raymond Carver story
about a situation like this once... 

SAMSON
I seem to remember thinking there was a
lesson in it but it eludes me at the
moment. So much for the insights of
literature.
BANNER
Whatever you may think, I didn’t come
here to see Betty... 
SAMSON
Then why did you come?
BANNER
I have a problem... I thought part of the
solution might be here.
SAMSON
Cryptic. But I’ll take it at face value.
I’ll confess something to you if you’ll
clear up some things for me... First, I
confess, as a man... as Betty’s lover... 
that I have always hoped you were dead.
Not because I didn’t like you but because
I love Betty and I’ve known that unless
you were really gone, or she believed you
were, that there would always be three of
us in this relationship.  I’ve dreaded
the thought of you walking through the
door. But now that you’re here... I have
to admit that I’m very happy about it.
Because I’m also a psychiatrist. And I’m
very committed to putting light into dark
corners, so to speak, and I’m very good
at finding my way into the places people
hide their secrets. I do it primarily
because I think it helps them but also
frankly because I’m interested in what
people have to hide. Betty has a very
dark corner that I have never found my
way into, despite considerable, careful
effort. And the only thing I know about
her dark place is that you are in it.
And I’m wondering if you’ll be honest
enough to tell me: why are you something
that she won’t talk about?
BANNER
There are... aspects of my personality
that I can’t control. And I hurt
Betty... in ways I will never forgive
myself for.
SAMSON
You don’t drop your career and fall off
the face of the earth for five years
because you’ve got an anger management
issue, Bruce.  You see a shrink.
BANNER
It’s a little more complicated than that.
Samson, I’ve been alone for a long time
now. I have to be. The toughest part of
it is that I worry about what I’ve done
to Betty.  If she’s happy and you’re a
part of that, then that makes me very
happy. Honestly.  The last thing I want
to do is cause any trouble for her... or
for you. I’d kill myself before I’d hurt
her again.
SAMSON
Totally honest and yet avoiding
something. Exactly like her.
SAMSON
Just promise me you’ll come straight
home... 
BETTY
Ready?
BANNER
Stop a second... 
BANNER
What were we doing here? I mean what were
we really trying to accomplish? Do you
ever ask yourself that?
BETTY
We were trying to... understand. Crack a
puzzle. Advance things a little.
BANNER
I think that’s what we told ourselves.
At least the General was honest about
what he wanted out of it. I don’t think
we were as honest.
BETTY
No, you’ve turned this on yourself too
hard. We did talk about it and we were
all comfortable. The worst you can say is
that you rushed it... but you took your
own risks, you didn’t ask anybody else
too.
BANNER
But it wasn’t me that died.
BETTY
Nobody thought something like that was
possible... 
BANNER
I don’t know... Nature took a long time to
build us like we are... this whole
delicate wonderfully sophisticated system
refined over billions of years.  We come
in and monkey with it... think we can
improve it overnight.  Sooner or later
it’s going to blow up in our face... 
BANNER
They’re here.
BETTY
What... ?
BANNER
Go home.  You’ve got to get as far away
from me as you can, right now!  Go!!
BLONSKY
Got him.
BLONSKY
Shit. We’re made. He’s going inside.
BLONSKY
Look alive, this could get interesting.
BETTY
I know it’s you!
CABOT
Sir... sir?
CABOT
It’s your daughter.
BETTY
Come out of there!
BETTY
Please don’t do this...  He needs help!
ROSS
You can’t see this clearly now get
inside.
SOLDIER’S VOICE
Target is in the overpass. Have visual.
ONE OF ROSS’S SOLDIERS
There he is!
ROSS
Do not engage! Repeat: do NOT engage!
CABOT
Hold positions, stand down.
ROSS
Put canisters in that tube, one on either
side.
BETTY
BRuCE!!
ROSS
Get her back here!!
CABOT
Geiger’s lighting up!
ROSS
Alright... now we’ll see.
CABOT
They should not put this in the
recruitment video.
ROSS
We’re going to Bravo. Move him 360 in
range of the cannons. Keep your cool and
be ready to move. Alpha Team give him all
of it.
ROSS
If you can’t push him get him to chase
you but move him toward those cannons,
damn it--!
BLONSKY
Cover me
BLONSKY
Remember me?
ROSS
Jesus, he’s doing it...  EARS ON!!
BLONSKY
Hit him
ROSS
Nets!
BETTY
You’re killing him!
SAMSON
BEtTY!!
BETTY
BRuUCE!!
BETTY
BRyCE!!
PILOT’S VOICE
Two minutes out, Major... 
ROSS
All positions, keep him engaged, don’t
let him leave and prepare to fall back on
my order... 
PILOT’S VOICE
Closing... what’s the target?
CABOT
290 from my position, 300 yds, ten feet
tall and green
PILOT’S VOICE
Come again.
ROSS
You heard right.  Put everything you’ve
got on it. Take it out. Ground teams pull
back... 
BLONSKY
Come on, Banner!!  That all you got!?
ROSS
Blonsky, fall back now!
BLONSKY
Come on let’s see what else you’ve g--
ROSS
Fall back! Bird hitting the deck, fall
back!
BETTY
Bruce... ?
PILOT’S VOICE
Hold onto your hats... 
ROSS
Hold fire---!!!
SAMSON
No!
CABOT
CEaSE FIRE!!
ROSS
You did the right thing calling us.
ROSS
You’re doubting it now because it went
bad but your instincts were right. You
see who he is now... what he is.
SAMSON
No, I don’t actually. He wasn’t what I
thought he’d be at all.  It was strange
to me that she would never say what had
happened between them... she’s one of the
most honest people I know.  But it was
this, wasn’t it?
too... you were all a part of it?
ROSS
I need to know where they’re going.
She’ll be in incredible danger as long as
she’s with him.
SAMSON
From who? He protected her. You almost
killed her.
ROSS
I give you my word that her safety is my
main concern at this point. Bruce’s as
well. I care about him more than you
realize. I don’t want to hurt him, I want
to help him.
SAMSON
You know it’s a point of professional
pride with me that I can always tell when
somebody is lying. He wasn’t... and you
are. But I don’t know where he was going.
I know that she’ll help him if she can.
ROSS
Then she’ll be aiding a fugitive and I
won’t be able to help either of them.
SAMSON
I used to wonder why she never talked
about you... now I know.
BETTY
Oh no... I’m sorry... I’m... 
BETTY
You’re hurt.
BETTY
Bruce, can you understand me? Are you
hurt?
BETTY
It’s okay... we’re okay.
BETTY
Come here...  come on.
ROSS
Will he walk again?
DOCTOR
Most of the bones in his body look like
crushed gravel right now. If he lives
he’ll be lucky if he can lift the straw
to eat his liquid meals.
DOCTOR
I will say this, he’s got a heart like a
machine. Never seen anything like it
outside a race horse.
BETTY
Still feeling sick?
BANNER
No, I feel better.  Getting my data back.
BETTY
I think I’ve got a good selection for
you. First things first... 
BANNER
You’re kidding me... 
BETTY
Target: they’ve got everything. Okay, it
ain’t Armani but... 
BANNER
I’m an irradiated freak, that doesn’t
mean I’ve lost my sense of style.
BETTY
When was the last time anybody but you
cut your hair, Mr. Style Council?
BETTY
I have done this before.
BETTY
I don’t know how you’ve done this alone.
BANNER
With clippers usually... No, I didn’t want
you to be afraid all the time.
BETTY
It is frightening. But it was worse not
knowing... 
BANNER
No, wait... I’m sorry... 
BETTY
What... ?
BANNER
We can’t... 
BETTY
It’s okay... I want to.
BANNER
No...  I can’t. I can’t get too... excited.
BETTY
Not even a little excited?
BANNER
I thought I couldn’t risk this... that it
was better to deal with it alone. But it
wasn’t... this is better.  I wanted so
much to... it was so hard just to move
from place to place... so risky. I sent
you small things to try to let you
know...  I sent you a Canthia Tigris from
Brazil. I don’t know if... 
BETTY
I got it.
BANNER
I’m so sorry... so sorry...

Rumors continue to swirls about a violent
clash between forces of the US Army and
an unknown adversary on the campus of
Southern Polytech earlier today... 
Authorities have renewed the long-cold
hunt for fugitive government scientist
David Bruce Banner
ROSS
... for goddsake Sam, the National Guard
can’t get tents to hurricane zones in
time, you’re telling me I’ve got to liase
with part-timers?
GRELLER
It’s domestic on paper so Guard and FBI
have to be involved... 
ROSS
FBI!!  Did the Chiefs get a look at those
tapes?! Do they think that was a video
game?
GRELLER
They saw them, nobody’s doubting
anymore... 
ROSS
What’s the FBI gonna do... pull out
badges? Why don’t we get ATF while we’re
at it!
GRELLER
It’s formalities, T. Use em for intel and
then tell em to back off. The Chiefs are
giving you total authority to run this
operation.  Make your list of what you
need and get back to me.
REPORTER
Very few outside the military got a first-
hand look at their rumored adversary.
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Kevin Feige
were coming home from a hike and
witnessed some of the battle. McGhee
captured this on his cell phone
REPORTER
Can you describe what you saw?
MCGHEE
Dude, it was like a huge and green... 
HUGE...  I mean like the way Steve Nash
looks standing next to Shaq... Shaq would
look like that standing next to this...

Dude, it was so big.  It was like this

REPORTER
Further search for the mysterious ‘Hulk’
was delayed by powerful thunderstorms in
the Smoky Mountain National forest.
CABOT
It’s Blonsky.
ROSS
Has anybody found out if he has next of
kin or family?
CABOT
You can ask him yourself.
BLONSKY
Sir.
ROSS
Good to see you on your feet, Soldier.
How do you feel?
BLONSKY
Pissed off and ready for Round 3.
BANNER
Can’t use any of it but the cash. Don’t
even turn the phone on, they can track
it.
BETTY
My lipstick? Can they track that?
BANNER
No you can keep that.
BETTY
Not going to get where we’re going on 70
bucks.
BANNER
Not quickly enough.
BANNER
No. It’s the only thing of hers that you
have. No.
BETTY
We’ll get it back.
CABOT
... Federal is already monitoring phone,
plastic and Dr. Ross’s web accounts, and
local PD’s have been put on alert... 
They’ll pop up somewhere and when they do
it comes straight to us... 
ROSS
They won’t just pop up. He made it five
years and got across borders without
making a mistake and he won’t use a damn
credit card now. If he was trying to
escape he’d be long gone.  But he’s not
trying to escape... he’s looking for help.
And that’s how we’re going to get him. We
don’t know where they’re going but we
know what they’re after and we know he’s
been talking to somebody.  You’ve all got
copies of that correspondence. There are
only a few hundred people in world who
have what he needs. Figure out who they
are, he’s going to one of them.
CABOT
Under no circumstances whatsoever are
your people to engage these subjects
directly. Apprehension will be handled
exclusively from this office. Call it in
and we’ll tell you what to do.
BETTY
We’ll get it back.
BANNER
Mind if I send a quick email off your
account?
BETTY
Hey... 
BETTY
It’s been worse than this before right?
BANNER
Yes... much worse.
BETTY
Then we’re on the way to something
better.
BETTY
Penny for your thoughts.
BANNER
How long have you known Samson?
BETTY
About a year and a half. He came to
lecture on a fellowship and stayed.
BANNER
Do you trust him?
BETTY
Yes.  I do.  BANNER, you know that I... 
BANNER
You don’t have to explain anything to me.
Ever.  He seems like a good man and he
treats you well and that makes me happy.
BETTY
He does.  I never trusted him with this.
Trust isn’t the right word. I didn’t test
his faith in me by asking him to believe
something I still can’t believe myself.
BANNER
Who could?  Sometimes I even convince
myself it’s not real.
BETTY
What is it like... when it happens? What
do you experience?
BANNER
Remember those clinical experiments we
volunteered for at Harvard? The induced
hallucinations? It’s like that, amplified
by a thousand.  It feels like someone is
pouring a liter of acid into my brain.
The sound is the worst.
BETTY
Do you remember anything?
BANNER
Fragments.  Nothing I can derive anything
from.
BETTY
But then it’s still you... inside it.
BANNER
It’s not me.
BETTY
In the cave, I felt that you knew... that
IT knew me.  Maybe your mind is in there
it’s just... overcharged... can’t process
what’s happening. You know Samson works
with people on ‘conscious dreaming’,
helping them direct themselves out of
their nightmares even though the
conscious brain seems asleep...  maybe... 
BANNER
I don’t want to control it.  I want to
get rid of it.  It kills people. It
almost killed you. I didn’t do those
things.
BETTY
Of course not... 
ROSS
You ready?
BLONSKY
Let’s even the game a little.
BETTY
I thought I should let you sleep.
BANNER
Where are we?
BETTY
Stuck in traffic. But getting close.
BANNER
Let’s go.
BETTY
Go where?
BANNER
We’ve got to get out.
BETTY
Right here... I mean... now?
BANNER
Yes, right here
BETTY
Long way uptown. Subway’s quickest.
BANNER
Me in a tight metal tube underground with
hundreds of other people in the most
aggressive city in the world?
BETTY
Right. Let’s get a cab.
BETTY
... god forbid you should give a SHIT
about the living, breathing PEOPLE in the
back of your office on wheels with no
SHOCcS... 
DRIVER
What’s the matter baby? You no like a
good ride?
BETTY
Asshole!!
BANNER
You know I can show you some techniques
to help you manage that rage a little
better... 
BETTY
Zip it.  We’re walking.
OFFICER
That’s from Quantico. They’re getting
blanked.  The academic language in the
published stuff could be three dozen off
our list. And we haven’t even got samples
for three dozen more.
STERNS
“... full cell saturation, a method of
moving desired compounds into every cell
in the body which will revolutionize
medical therapies.”
STUDENT
What’s his name?
STERNS
Who, Mr. Blue here?
CABOT
They’re going to New York!!
BETTY
Excuse me, Dr Sterns?
STERNS
Yes.
BETTY
Sorry to bother you. I’m Elizabeth Ross.
STERNS
Dr. Ross, my goodness... I read your
wonderful paper on synthesizing
nucleotides!! To what do I owe the... 
BETTY
There’s someone I’d like to introduce you
to... 
BANNER
Mr. Blue, I presume.
STERNS
Mr Green!
STERNS
... it took some work, let me tell you,
we’ve never tried to concentrate the
trimethodine a tenth of what your peak
exposure correlates with.  That you
survived an event like that to stand here
and discuss this
do with Dr. Ross’s protein primer
capacitating the cells of course, but
it’s beyond my reckoning... we could study
it for years.
BETTY
But you think you’ve got the
concentration right?
STERNS
Well yes... on paper anyway. And my cell
saturation will make sure we don’t miss
any spots... but... even if we hit the
levels right, I can’t promise this will
cure you. It might only be an antidote to
suppress the specific flare up.
When you have one of these ‘spikes’ ... 
is the experience extreme?
BANNER
You might say that.
STERNS
Well I can’t wait to see it!  You know I
must say... I wondered if you were real.
And if you were I wondered what it would
look like... a person with that much power
lurking in him. Nothing could have
surprised me more than this unassuming
young man shaking my hand!
I’d be remiss however if I didn’t point
out that these concentrations carry
extraordinary levels of toxicity. If
we’re over by even a small integer, the
residual could kill you. Will kill you.
BANNER
There’s a flip side to that ...  if we
miss on the low side... if we induce me
and it fails... it will be very dangerous
for you.
STERNS
I’ve always been more curious than
cautious. It’s served me well so far but
if that’s what kills this cat in the
end... well at least I’ll have peeked
around a few corners.

STERNS
So then we’re all agreed?
Into the Glorious Unknown!
SOLDIER
How you feeling, man?
BLONSKY
Like a monster.
BLONSKY
Back on the Hulk Hunt, Major... 
CABOT
Banner is the target. Snipers have the
point. Delta in backup. If we make it
before they move we’ll have two tries. If
we can’t take him inside, we’ll try for a
shot as he exits.

CABOT
If we can’t hit him unaware before he
makes the street then plainclothes will
try to follow and we stand down. Under no
circumstance is Banner to be engaged
directly. If we can’t get a shot we fall
back and let him go.
BLONSKY
And if he goes nuclear?
ROSS
Then we’ll have failed to learn from our
mistakes, won’t we? You’ve got the
compact sonics. Try to at least move him
out of the city center toward the river.
Then disengage. We’ll follow from the air
but not fight. Any questions?
BLONSKY
Not much of a rematch.
CABOT
1.5 Million people within a five mile
radius.  You want to fight that thing
here?
CABOT
You sure about your boy?
ROSS
I need a dog in the hunt that’s not going
to run from a bear if it shows up. If we
do this right, I’ll never have to let him
off the leash.
BANNER
Think of all the money I’ll save on
wardrobe if this works. If this starts to
go bad, promise me you won’t stay and try
to help me.
BETTY
Bruce... 
BANNER
It’s the worst when it starts. You have
to promise me you’ll run or I can’t do
this.
STERNS
If you have a strong reaction these will
keep you from hurting yourself.
BANNER
If I have a strong reaction you’re not
going to need to worry about me.
STERNS
Ready?
STERNS
My God... !
BETTY
There’s more. Wait for it!
BETTY
Now! Do it!
BETTY
BRuCE, STAY WITH ME!
BETTY
Do it NOW!!!!
BETTY
It’s alright. You’re alright. It’s over.
STERNS
... the pulse came from the amygdala. I
think Dr. Ross’ ‘primer’ lets the cells
absorb the energy temporarily and then it
abates. That’s why you didn’t die of
radiation sickness years ago. Now maybe
we’ve neutralized those cells permanently
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

STERNS
I’m inclined to think the latter because
none of our test subjects had a decline
in absorption capacity, but of course
they were getting Gamma in MUCH lower
doses externally each time...  But You!
It’s like you’ve got a turbo booster in
your brain. It’s one of the most
wonderful things I’ve ever seen!
BETTY
It’s not wonderful for Bruce.
STERNS
In a medical science sense, of course.
You’re miraculous.
BETTY
So how did you know it would work?
STERNS
I didn’t. But now that we have the data
on Bruce’s initial -
BANNER
Wait. You said ‘test subjects’. What test
subjects?
CABOT
Target is the tallest, in the middle.
BANNER
Oh my god...  what have you been doing?
STERNS
Well you didn’t send me much of yourself
to work with and I couldn’t risk blowing
the opportunity so we concentrated it and
grew more. The same thing you were trying
to do with the corablanca!  You were my
flower, see?
STERNS
A lot of the first pass didn’t survive of
course but as you can see we’re doing
much better.  And we’re only giving them
very low-dose Gamma so no power-lifters
yet but the interesting thing... 
BANNER
You’ve got to destroy all of it.
STERNS
Sorry, what... 
BANNER
All of it.  Right now. Show me your
supply.
STERNS
You must be joking.  We’ll share a Nobel
for this, the three of us! Think of the
applications.
BANNER
It doesn’t matter if it can’t be
controlled... You don’t know the power of
what we’re dealing with here!
STERNS
But we’ve got the antidote now!
CABOT
At your discretion shooter.
SHOOTER
Almost... 
SHOOTER
No shot.
SOLDIER
Blonsky’s going in... he’s going in!
ROSS
Blonsky! Stand down!
CABOT
Shooter, be advised... 
SHOOTER
Almost... 
BANNER
They don’t want the antidote! They want a
weapon. They want it to fight for them
and if they get it then we lose control
of it!
STERNS
Oh look I hate the government too but
you’re being a little paranoid don’t you
th---?
SHOOTER
Target is hit... Dart onboard.
BANNER
Get out now.
BLONSKY
Come on! COME ON!! WHERE IS IT?!
SOLDIER
BLOnSKY!!!
CABOT
Never seen anyone come round from a tranq
dose like that. Why the hell aren’t we
keeping him under?
ROSS
You want to be the one to stick a needle
in his arm that he doesn’t want? She’s
our best insurance. Keep her right next
to him... He knows if he pops off it’s her
that gets hurt.
CABOT
What do you want to do with Sterns?
ROSS
I want him pinned in that lab with you.
Don’t let him leave the room to piss
until he’s identified every bottle, every
box, every machine in the place.  Then
package it up and get it back home. Then
get aiding and abetting charges and get
him turned over to us. If Banner won’t
give us answers maybe we can get him to.
ROSS
Betty... 
BETTY
I will never forgive what you have done
to him. And to me.
ROSS
He is a fugitive. He made choices and I
have a responsibility... 
BETTY
You made him a fugitive! To cover your
failures and save your career. He told me
what you said to him after the accident,
before I woke up... what you proposed.
That’s why he ran and gave up... 
ROSS
His work... his blood... is the property of
the United States Army and my Duty
supersedes my personal feelings in this
matter.
BETTY
Truth Justice and the American Way... 
ROSS
Something like that.
BETTY
You have to start with Truth or the rest
of it doesn’t work. Don’t speak to me as
your daughter. Not ever again.
ROSS
It’s only because you’re my daughter that
you’re not in handcuffs too.
CABOT
... then it’s not the same.
STERNS
Not exactly no, but it could be better.
What happened to him was a freak
accident. We’ve sorted out some of the
pieces but I don’t think I could put
together the same Humpty Dumpty just yet
if you follow me... 
CABOT
I don’t want to know if you can make
another one I want to know if Banner’s
the only serious threat at the
STERNS
Jeez, what is it with you hitting people
all the ti---?
STERNS
What could I have possibly done to
deserve this?
BLONSKY
It’s not what you’ve done. It’s what
you’re going to do.
STERNS
Well I like your use of future tense in
that sentence anyway.
BLONSKY
I want what you got out of Banner.
STERNS
You’ve got it!  Before you knocked the
Major out I told her I’ll help in any way
as long as I can... 
BLONSKY
I want it in me.
STERNS
You look like you’ve got a little
something extra in you already, don’t
you.
BLONSKY
I want more. You saw what he becomes?
STERNS
I did. It’s beautiful... God-like.  But I
can’t make you like that...  I don’t know
what’s in you... the mix could be
something terrible.
STERNS
I’m not unwilling I just need ‘informed
consent’... and you’ve given it!
SOLDIER 2
... ten feet and green... You’re getting
your news off Inside Edition. “The
Hulk”...  gimme a break... 
SOLDIER

SOLDIER 2
Only action we’re gonna see is those blue-
shirts bringing each other coffee... 
SOLDIER
Delta 4 to Leader, something big just
went off down here!
ROSS
This is Ross. What went off?
SOLDIER
The whole floor just blew out Blonsky,
Stoller, Robertson and the Major... they
were all still up there!!
ROSS
Get our teams moving back there and get
PD Special Units out...  Turn us around... 
BANNER
We’re going back... 
SOLDIER 2
I’m going up... 
COP 1
What in God’s name was that?
SOLDIER 1
The Hulk’s in the street!
SOLDIER 1
Repeat: THE HULK IS IN THE STREET! Where
the hell are we? 120TH AND BROADWAY,
HEADINg UP BROADWAY!!
ROSS
Hold it together, soldier! Have any of
you got a live feed?
SOLDIER 1
Yeah... 
ROSS
Then stay with it and get me a visual,
we’ve got help on the way. Now get
moving!
SOLDIER 1
C’mon!!
SOLDIER 1
Can you drive this thing?
COP 1
Marines, 8 years. Let’s go.
ROSS
Goddam it I said get me eyes on that
thing!
SOLDIER
Sit down!
BANNER
Shoot me... let’s see what happens.
SOLDIER 1
Sir are you seeing this? What the hell is
that? Is that Banner?
ROSS
No. Is it Sterns?
CABOT
General, it’s Blonsky. Sterns is dead... 
It’s Blonsky.
ROSS
Hit it with whatever you’ve got, try to
draw it after you and get it to the
river. We’ve got cutters on both sides of
the island with sonic!
SOLDIER 2
What are you doing?
SOLDIER 1
You think a rifle’s gonna hurt that?
Blonsky told me he put in some
ordinance... 
SOLDIER 1
That’s what I’m talking about, G!
SOLDIER 1
Now say ‘good night, Gracie’... 
SOLDIER 2
Time to go!
DRIVER
This is bullshit, people!!
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
General, NYPD wants to know what to use
against it, SAC has that A-10 in the air
and ready...  What do you want me to tell
them?
BETTY
The sound waves stopped it at the
campus... they stopped Bruce... 
ROSS
They need an open field of fire, there’s
too much down there to absorb them... too
many places to hide... 
BANNER
You can’t stop it, you have to kill it.
ROSS
And what do you propose, a bomb? How big
should it be, you tell me!
BANNER
You have to take me back there.
BETTY
No... 
BANNER
It’s the only thing that can stop it. I’m
the only thing that can stop it.
ROSS
Forget it, if I put you down there you
won’t fight, you’ll run.
BANNER
We made that thing, you and I!!  We’ve
got to try something! I think you were
right, it’s still me. I heard you on the
table calling to me and I held on... 
BETTY
You think you can control it?
BANNER
No but maybe I can aim it.
ROSS
What if you just double my problem?
BANNER
Have you got a better idea?
ROSS
Put us near it. Get those cuffs off him.
BANNER
No...  Open the door.  Do it!
BANNER
Put me over it! Go higher!
BETTY
Oh my god, no... what are you doing?! You
don’t even know if you’ll turn!
BANNER
I tried to do this a long time ago, when
I thought I’d killed you. It wouldn’t let
me.
BETTY
This is too risky, it’s insane!
BANNER
I know, but I have to try. I’m sorry.
LOUDMOUTH

motherfuckin’ fifteen foot monster
buggin’ out in the WHITE man’s

Oh, I see... it’s a family thing. I’m
gonna let you all work this out.

They’re a block north of the university
again... can we get a local chopper with a
spot on it, maybe we can give him some
help.
ROSS
Fire! Give him all of it!
MOM
And that is why I tell you, “never go

Wow.

Shh. It’s over...  it’s over.
HULK
Betty.
CABOT
You gotta be kidding me... 
BETTY
Hi.
SAMSON
Oh, thank god. You’re alright? When I
couldn’t reach you... 
BETTY
I’m not hurt. A lot of people were
though.
SAMSON
I know, it’s been all over the tv. It
doesn’t seem real.
BETTY
It was real.
SAMSON
Come home.  Just come home.
BETTY
Samson, did you call somebody the night
Bruce was at our home? Is that why they
came for him?
SAMSON
I was frightened. Forgive me.
BETTY
I do. But I’m not coming home yet.
SAMSON
Where are you going?
BETTY
I have no idea. But I’ll let you know
when I do. I promise.
