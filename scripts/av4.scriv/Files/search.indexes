            <Text>CLINT: Okay, hold on. Don't shoot. You see where you're going? 
LILA: Mhm.  
CLINT: Okay, now let's worry about how you get there. [Clint corrects his daughter's foot to the proper position, and adjusts her shooting stance.] 
CLINT: Put your foot this way. Here. Can you see? 
LILA: Yeah. 
CLINT: You sure? 
LILA: Mhm. [Clint pushes Lila's hair in front of her face while covering her left eye.] 
CLINT: How about now? 
[Both Lila and Clint giggle, as the camera panels into a long shot showing a target nailed on a tree, and the rest of Barton family having a picnic in the field.] 
CLINT: Alright. Ready your fingers. 
COOPER: Nice. 
LAURA: Nice throw, kiddo. 
COOPER: You go. 
LAURA: Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? [Camera switches to Lila who then proceeds to look at Clint.] 
LILA: Who wants mayo on a hotdog? 
CLINT: Probably your brothers.  
[Clint looks at his wife, Laura] 
CLINT: Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. [Camera switches to Laura facing Nathaniel] 
LAURA: Mayo or mustard? 
NATHANIEL: How about ketchup? 
LAURA: Ketchup? [Camera switches back to Clint and his daughter] 
CLINT: Mind your elbow. [Lila releases the arrow and it hits the target directly in the bullseye.] 
CLINT: Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow. 
LAURA: Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on! 
CLINT: Alright, we're coming; we're hungry. [Clint looks behind him, but there's no one there, but dust being blown away by the wind.] 
CLINT: Lila, let's go. [Clint starts to look around] 
CLINT: Lila? [Clint starts to move and look around, and pick up the bow she had.] 
CLINT: Honey? Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura? 
[Lightning crackles] 
[SOMEWHERE IN SPACE] 
[Opening sequence begins with Dear Mr. Fantasy playing] 
[Scene switches to Nebula and Tony on the ship playing paper football] 
NEBULA: Wrra! [Nebula, frustrated, puts her hands in a fighting stance while looking at Tony] 
TONY: You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony] 
TONY: Oh yeah, that was close. [Nebula once again flicks a paper football towards Tony] 
TONY: That's a goal. You're now one apiece. 
NEBULA: I would like to try again. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony] 
TONY: We tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.  
[Tony poorly flicks a paper football towards Nebula] 
TONY: That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. [Nebula flicks the paper football towards Tony] 
TONY: And... you've won. Congratulations.  [Tony reaches his hand out to shake Nebula's hand] 
TONY: Fair game. Good sport. [Nebula shakes Tony's hand] 
TONY: Have fun? 
NEBULA: It was fun.  
[Camera switches to see Iron Man's busted helmet. Tony Stark's hand reaches forward to turn on the helmet. We pan out to see that he's sitting on the floor of a gloomy Benatar. The weight of the recent events of INFINITY WAR evident in Tony's posture. He taps the helmet with a sigh.] 
TONY: This thing on? [The helmet scans Tony. Tony leans against the wall while taking deep breaths. He looks weak and malnutrition.] 
TONY: Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. 
TONY: If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god,  I hope so. 
TONY: Today is day 21, uh 22. [Cut to Tony standing at a window to stare out in space, waiting for his impending doom to arrive.] 
TONY: You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. [Cut to a shot of Nebula sitting in the back of the Benatar.] 
TONY: You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. [A shot of Tony and Nebula working on the fuel cells of the Benatar.] 
TONY: But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7 -11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. It's always you.
TONY: I couldn't stop him. 
STEVE: Neither could I. 
TONY STARK : I lost the kid. 
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, we lost. 
TONY STARK : Is ummm... [Tony struggles to ask about Pepper.] 
PEPPER POTTS : Oh my God! [She and Tony embrace.] 
TONY STARK : It's okay. [In the AVenGERS Compound. The heroes are sitting in a living room area. Tony is sitting at a table, getting blood for healing.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF: It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth. World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... exactly what he said he was going to do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures. 
TONY STARK : Where is he now? Where? 
STEVE ROGERS : We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through. 
[Cut to a shot of a sullen-looking Thor, sitting on a bench, seemingly deep in thought.] 
TONY STARK : What's wrong with him? 
ROCKET : Yeah, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but there's a lot of that's goin' around, ain't there? 
TONY STARK : Honestly, until this exact second, I thought you were a Build-A-Bear. 
ROCKET : Maybe I am. 
STEVE ROGERS : We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him. 
TONY STARK : Who told you that? I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the stone. That's what happened. There was no fight. 
STEVE ROGERS : Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything? 
TONY STARK : Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming. 
STEVE ROGERS : Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus. 
TONY STARK : And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need? [Tony stands, pushing things off the table with a clatter. Everyone winces at the noise.] I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling you, Cap.  
[Tony goes for Steve. Rhodey quickly comes in front of him, trying to stop him.] 
RHODEY : Tony, Tony, Tony, stop! 
TONY STARK : Otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedom or not- that's what we needed! 
STEVE ROGERS : Well, that didn't work out, did it? 
TONY STARK : I said, "we'll lose". You said, "We'll do that together too." And guess what, cap? We lost. You weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the AVenGERS, we're the AVenGERS. Not the Prevengers, right? 
RHODEY : Okay, you made your point. Just sit down, ok? 
TONY STARK : Nah, nah, nah. [He pushes Rhodey away] Here's my point. 
RHODEY : Sit down! 
TONY STARK : [Referring to Carol] She's great, by the way. We need you. You're new blood.  
RHODEY : Tony! 
TONY STARK : Bunch of tired old mills! I got nothing for you, cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no plan, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar.  
[Steve looks affected by Tony's words. The old friends just gaze at each other. After a moment, Tony rips his Arc Reactor from his chest and shoves it into Steve's hand.] 
TONY STARK : Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide. 
[Tony falls to the ground. Steve is by his side and everyone is starting to gather.] 
RHODEY : Tony! 
TONY STARK : I'm fine. I... 
[Tony falls into a heap, unconscious.]  
[Cut to a shot of Tony on a bed, with Pepper at his side.] 
RHODEY : Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna be out for the rest of the day. 
CAROL DANVERS : You guys take care of him. And I'll bring Xorrian Elixir when I come back. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Where are you going? 
CAROL DANVERS : To kill Thanos. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Hey, you know, we usually work as a team around here, and between you and I, we're also a little fragile. 
STEVE ROGERS : We realize out there is more of your territory, but this is our fight too. 
RHODEY : Do you even know where he is? 
CAROL DANVERS : I know people who might. 
NEBULA : [Standing behind Carol] Don't bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. Then when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I'd ask "where would we go once his plan was complete?". His answer was always the same: To the Garden. 
RHODEY : That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan. 
STEVE ROGERS : So where is he then? 
ROCKET : When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago. [A hologram of a planet pops up, with a shockwave visibly traversing the surface.] On this planet. 
NEBULA : Thanos is there. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : He used the stones again. 
BRUCE BANNER : Hey, Hey, we'd be going in short-handed, you know. 
RHODEY : Look, he's still got the stones, so... 
CAROL DANVERS : So let's get him... We'll use them to bring everyone back. 
RHODEY : Just like that? 
STEVE ROGERS : Yeah, just like that. 
[Steve and Carol share a knowing look.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try. 
BRUCE BANNER : If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before? 
CAROL DANVERS : Because before, you didn't have me. 
RHODEY : Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time. 
CAROL DANVERS : There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys. 
[Thor, who has been eating a snack behind all this time, stands up and walks over to Carol. He holds his hand up, and catcher Stormbreaker as it flies over to him, missing Carol by inches. But Carol doesn't even flinch, instead smiling at the God of Thunder.] 
THOR : I like this one. 
STEVE ROGERS : Let's go get this son of a bitch. 
[Cut to a shot of everyone except for Tony aboard the Benatar.] 
ROCKET : Okay, who here hasn't been to space? 
[Nat, Cap, and Rhodey raise their hands.] 
RHODEY : Why? 
ROCKET : You better not throw up on my ship. 
NEBULA : Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1! 
[The ship jumps forward into a wormhole, and we see Steve holding onto his seat for dear life. The ship slows down, and the ship hovers in orbit of the planet seen in the hologram previously. Captain Marvel hovers in front of the Benatar.] 
CAROL DANVERS : I'll head down for ground recon. 
[A shot of the passengers inside the Benatar preparing for the impending confrontation.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : This is gonna work, Steve. 
STEVE ROGERS : I know it will. 
[We see Steve holding a compass with an image of Peggy Carter.] 
STEVE ROGERS : Because I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't. 
[Captain Marvel approaches the Benatar.] 
CAROL DANVERS: No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him. 
NEBULA : Then that's enough. 
ROCKET : Oh no. 
STEVE ROGERS : Where are they? 
CAROL DANVERS : Answer the question! 
THANOS : The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation. 
BRUCE BANNER : You murdered trillions! 
THANOS : You should be grateful. 
NATASHA ROMANONFF : Where are the stones? 
THANOS : Gone. Reduced to atoms. 
BRUCE BANNER : You used them two days ago! 
THANOS : I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly... killed me. But the work is done. it always will be. I am inevitable. 
RHODEY : We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying. 
NEBULA : My father is many things. A liar is not one of them. 
THANOS : Ah, thank you, daughter. Perhaps I treated you too harshly. 
[We cut to see Thor, his face filled with rage as he raises to summon Stormbreaker, and before anyone can stop him, SLICES Thanos' head off. Thanos' limp body falls to the floor.] 
ROCKET : What... What did you do? 
[Thor looks broken, realizing what he has done.] 
THOR : I went for the head. 
MAN #1 : So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. First time in five years, you know? Sit there, dinner... I didn't know what to talk about. 
STEVE ROGERS : What did you talk about? 
MAN #1 : Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. Then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads. 
MAN #2 : How about you? 
MAN #1 : I cried... just before dessert. But I'm seeing him tomorrow, so... 
STEVE ROGERS : That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. [Another man during the therapy session is seen starting to tear up.] And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps you gotta take. To try and become whole again. To try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You got to move on. Got to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we have to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed us all. 
[Screen Title: SAN FRANCISCO] 
[The camera pans to San Francisco Bridge, all the way to a self-storage facility with a sign saying "U-STORE It, SELF STORAGE", with its interior filled stored stuff and junk until it spots Luis' van from "Ant-Man and the Wasp", behind a metallic fence with a label named "LANG". A rat crawls over the van's rear windSHIeld and accidentally activates the controls for opening the Quantum Realm, haphazardly activating the Quantum Realm. The rear door busts open, flinging Lang outside the van.] 
SCOTT LANG : [grunts as he pushes away a cushion out of his body, and deactivates the helmet, but still grunting in pain, as he sweeps away sparks from an electrical failure out of his suit, then try to stand up.] What the hell? 
[He manages to stand up, as another electrical failure sparks out of his gauntlets, and now looks around in a confused look.] 
SCOTT LANG : Hope? 
[Inside a security office, a security guard (Ken Jeong) reading a book as he looks upon his security screen, seeing something going on in one of the storage facilities. In the cameras, it shows Lang in his casual clothing, shouting, waving a sign with the word "HELP" written on it.] 
[Outside the facility, he pulls out a pushcart and looks back seeing the guard giving a stern look from far. He walks around until reaching his hometown, finding a post filled with MISSING posters, abandoned houses, a wrecked car, nothing but desolation. He then sees a kid in a bike pass by.] 
SCOTT LANG : [yells] Kid! Hey kid! 
[The kid stops his bike as he stares back in a serious look.] 
SCOTT LANG : What the hell happened here? 
[The kid still stares at him and is almost about to tear up, but immediately turns away from him and move on. Lang still gives the same confused look, as he arrives in somewhat a memorial called "THE VANISHED", with all the names of the people who became victims of the Decimation. As Lang arrives on one of the engraved stones, he immediately drops the handle in shock.] 
SCOTT LANG : No. Please. Please, please. [moves on to check the other side of the engraved stone] No, no, no. No. [Lang excuses aside a young couple as he keeps on checking another engraved stone if her daughter hadn't had her name on one.] Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no. 
[The camera keeps panning and switching as Lang checks the rest of engraved stones if her daughter's name was in one.] 
SCOTT LANG : [in a mantra-like] Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. [Lang looks at the engraved stone in shock, revealing his name in it.] 
SCOTT LANG: What? 
SCOTT LANG : Cassie? 
CASSIE LANG : Dad? [Both of them emotionally hug each other as both dad and daughter had reunited. Then Lang shoves her back, realizing that her daughter is now a full-grown teenager.] 
SCOTT LANG : You're so big! 
ROCKET : Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship that Danvers pinged. 
[The camera cuts showing a few of the AVenGERS in holographic calls from the left to right, respectively: Nebula and Rocket Raccoon, Okoye, Danvers with a tomboyish haircut, and Rhodes.] 
NEBULA : It was an infectious garbage scowl. 
ROCKET : So, thanks for the hot tip. [turns to Danvers and replies back with a smirk] 
CAROL DANVERS : Well, you were closer. 
ROCKET : Yeah. And we smell like garbage. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : [turns to Okoye] You get a reading on those tremors? 
OKOYE : It was a mild subduction under the African plate. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Do we have a visual? How are we handling it? 
OKOYE : Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : [turns to Danvers] Carol, are we seeing you here next month? 
CAROL DANVERS : Not likely. 
ROCKET : [realizing that she got a new haircut] What, you gonna get a new haircut? 
CAROL DANVERS : [irritated] Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets. 
ROCKET : [murmurs to himself] You took a point, you took a point. 
CAROL DANVERS : So you might not see me for a long time. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me. 
ROCKET : Okay. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Alright. [One by one, the AVenGERS cut off their calls one by one...] 
CAROL DANVERS : Good luck. [cuts off call] 
[except for Rhodes. Nat sighs exhausted, and sits down, as she notices Rhodes still online in the call.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Where are you? 
RHODEY : Mexico. The federales found a room filled with bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : It's probably a rival gang. 
RHODEY : Except it isn't. [Nat realizes something.] It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left...[Nat starts to show signs of sadness as she gradually tears up.] I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him. 
[In an abrupt moment of silence, she tries to chew her tears and emotional feelings as she eats a sandwich.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Will you find out where he's going next? 
RHODEY : Nat... 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Please. 
RHODEY : [reluctantly] Okay. [then Rhodes cuts off his] 
[Nat starts to cry as she tries to hold back her tears miserably.] 
STEVE ROGERS : You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already. [Out of nowhere, Roger slumps over a bookshelf, in the same mood as he is in the therapy session, as Nat wipes off the tears off her face.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : You here to do your laundry? 
STEVE ROGERS : To see a friend. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : [referring to herself] Clearly, your friend is fine. 
STEVE ROGERS : You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : In the Hudson? 
STEVE ROGERS : There's fewer ships, cleaner water. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. [jokingly smiles, as Rogers does the same] 
STEVE ROGERS : [Walks and talks to her...] Sorry. Force of habit. [...and throws his jacket, then sits down on another chair.] 
STEVE ROGERS : You know, I keep telling everyone they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : If I move on, who does this? 
STEVE ROGERS : Maybe it doesn't need to be done. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : [Deep in her thoughts] I used to have nothing. Then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better. 
STEVE ROGERS : We both need to get a life. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : [Smiling] You first. 
[A camera footage pops up in front of them, showing Scott Lang with his Quantum Realm Van behind him.] 
SCOTT LANG : Uh...Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me. 
STEVE ROGERS : [Standing up] Is this an old message? 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : [Also standing up] It's the front gate. 
SCOTT LANG : Ant-man? Ant-man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys. 
[Cut to Scott inside the AVenGERS Compound, pacing worriedly in front of Steve and Natasha.] 
STEVE ROGERS : Scott. Are you okay? 
SCOTT LANG : Yeah. I'm fine. 
[He struggles to ask about something. He finally blurts it out.] 
SCOTT LANG : Have either of you ever studied Quantum Physics? 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Only to make conversation. 
SCOTT LANG : Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my... [struggling to not tell the entire truth about their relationship] She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years. 
SCOTT LANG : Yeah, but that's just it. For me, it was five hours. 
[Steve and Nat share a quick bewildered glance.] 
SCOTT LANG : See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving. 
[He strides over to pick up Nat's sandwich, and bites into it.] 
STEVE ROGERS : Scott, what are you talking about? 
SCOTT LANG : What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos. 
STEVE ROGERS : Wait, are you talking about a time machine? 
SCOTT LANG : No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... No, it's crazy. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore. 
SCOTT LANG : So who do we talk to about this? 
[We cut to a cabin in the woods, at the bank of a lake. We see Tony Stark sitting outside what looks like a tiny shed.] 
TONY STARK : Chow time! [He seems to be speaking to someone unknown by the audience.] Morgoona? Morgan H. Stark. Want some lunch? 
MORGAN STARK : Define lunch or be disintegrated. [She puts on a silver and blue helmet similar to Iron Man's] 
[A girl with long dark hair walks out in front of Tony. This is Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter. She looks to be about 3-4 years of age.] 
TONY STARK : You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. [Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.] 
MORGAN STARK : Okay. 
TONY STARK : There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? Want a handful of crickets? 
MORGAN STARK : No. 
TONY STARK : That's what you want. How did you find this? 
MORGAN STARK : Garage. 
TONY STARK : Really? Were you looking for it? 
MORGAN STARK : No. I found it though. 
TONY STARK : You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her. 
[They start walking towards the house, but Tony notices a black Audi pulling coming to a stop a few meters away. Steve, Nat, and Scott get out of the car. Tony sighs. He is not looking forward to the discussion about to take place.] 
SCOTT LANG : [Cut to after Scott's plan has been explained to Tony] Now, we know what it sounds like... 
STEVE ROGERS : Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible? 
TONY STARK : Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck scale, which then triggers the Deutsch proposition. Can we agree on that? 
[Scott, Steve and Nat all look puzzled. Science is barely any of their fields.] 
STEVE ROGERS : Thank you. 
TONY STARK : In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home. 
SCOTT LANG : I did. 
TONY STARK : No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it? 
SCOTT LANG : [Trying to hide his pride] A time heist? 
TONY STARK : Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream? 
SCOTT LANG : The stones are in the past. We can go back and get them. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back. 
TONY STARK : Or screw it up worse than he already has, right? 
STEVE ROGERS : I don't believe we would. 
TONY STARK : Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise. 
SCOTT LANG : Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events - 
TONY STARK : I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future? 
SCOTT LANG : [embarrased] No. 
TONY STARK : Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Tony... We have to take a stand. 
TONY STARK : We did stand. And yet, here we are. 
SCOTT LANG : I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did. And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. Bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even... 
TONY STARK : That's right, Scott, I won't. Even. Got a kid. 
[Morgan runs to her dad, who picks her up.] 
MORGAN STARK : Mommy told me to come and save you. 
TONY STARK : Good job. I'm saved. [Turning to face Cap, Nat and Scott.] I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six. 
STEVE ROGERS : Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance. 
TONY STARK : I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch. 
[We see Cap, Nat and Scott walking back to their car outside Tony's house.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : He's scared. 
STEVE ROGERS : He's not wrong. 
SCOTT LANG : Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop? 
STEVE ROGERS : No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain. 
SCOTT LANG : [Incredulous, pointing to Tony's house] Bigger than his? 
[Cut to a cafe somewhere, we see Bruce Banner, but not the same one that we remember. He looks more... Professor Hulk.] 
BRUCE BANNER : Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating. [Pushing a plate forward] Try some of that. Have some eggs. 
SCOTT LANG : I'm so confused. 
BRUCE BANNER : [seriously] These are confusing times. 
SCOTT LANG : Right. No, no, that's not what I meant. 
BRUCE BANNER : [dropping the act] No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now. 
SCOTT LANG : Yeah! How? Why? 
BRUCE BANNER : Five years ago, we got our asses beat. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : No one blamed you, Bruce. 
BRUCE BANNER : I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds... 
[Three children behind Bruce walk up to him tentatively] 
GIRL : Excuse me, Mr. Hulk? 
BRUCE BANNER : Yes? 
GIRL : Can we get a photo? 
BRUCE BANNER : 100%, little person. Come on, step up. [Holding out the phone to Scott] You mind? 
SCOTT LANG : Oh. 
BRUCE BANNER : Say "green"! [The children and Bruce say Green as Scott snaps the photo.] 
BRUCE BANNER : Did you get that? 
SCOTT LANG : [leaning forward to hand back the phone] Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man. 
SCOTT LANG : They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does. 
BRUCE BANNER : Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to...[to one of the boys] You want to take a picture with him, right? [The boy shakes his head vigorously.] 
SCOTT LANG : He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either. 
BRUCE BANNER : But, come on, the kid! But he...but you... 
SCOTT LANG : I don't want a picture with them. 
BRUCE BANNER : [To the children] He's gonna feel bad. [To Scott] Sorry. They said they'd do it. 
SCOTT LANG : I don't want it anymore. 
BRUCE BANNER : No, no...you feel bad. 
SCOTT LANG : Just take the goddamn phone. 
GIRL : Thank you, Mr. Hulk. 
BRUCE BANNER : No, it's great kids. Thank you very much. Hulk out! 
STEVE ROGERS : Bruce. 
BRUCE BANNER : [Awkwardly] Dab! 
STEVE ROGERS : Bruce. 
BRUCE BANNER : Listen to your Mom. She knows better. 
STEVE ROGERS : About we were saying... 
BRUCE BANNER : Right. The Hulk time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too. 
[The scene cuts to Tony Stark in the kitchen washing dishes after dinner. As he finishes the last of them, stumbles upon a photo of both Stark and Parker, with Parker holding his Stark Internship certificate. Tony finally knows what he's fighting for.] 
[Cut to Tony talking to his computer, generating a holographic model of something he's working on.] 
TONY STARK : Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please. 
F.R.I.D.A.Y : Processing... 
TONY STARK : Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. Gotta take a second. 
F.R.I.D.A.Y : Just a moment. 
TONY STARK : And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda - 
F.R.I.D.A.Y : Model rendered. 
[In a complete shock of amazement, the render comes back as successful. Tony falls back, bewildered by this discovery..] 
TONY STARK: Shit! 
MORGAN STARK : Shit? 
[Morgan, who has been hiding behind him all this time, giggles as she repeats the word Tony just uttered.] 
TONY STARK : [Whispering] What are you doing up, little miss? 
MORGAN STARK : Shit. 
TONY STARK : No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her. 
MORGAN STARK : Why you up? 
TONY STARK : 'Cause I got some important shit going on here. What do you think? No, I got something on my mind.I got something on my mind. 
MORGAN STARK : Was it Juice Pops? 
TONY STARK : Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... my mind. [In Morgan's room] 
TONY STARK : You done? Yeah, now you are. [Pushing Morgan's head onto her pillow] That face goes there. 
MORGAN STARK : Tell me a story. 
TONY STARK : A story. Once upon a time, a girl went to bed. The end. 
MORGAN STARK : [Giggling] That's a horrible story. 
TONY STARK : Come on, that's your favourite story. I love you tons. 
MORGAN STARK : I love you 3000. 
TONY STARK : Wow. 3000. That's crazy. Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night. 
[Cut to the living room where Pepper is reading a book sitting on the couch. Tony paces in front of the fireplace.] 
TONY STARK : Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. [Pepper scoffs] 
TONY STARK : [Absentmindedly] What are you reading? 
PEPPER POTTS : Oh, it's just a book on composting. 
TONY STARK : [Still absentmindedly] What's new with composting? 
PEPPER POTTS : Just - 
TONY STARK : I figured it out, by the way. 
PEPPER POTTS : You know, just so we're talking about the same thing - 
TONY STARK : Time travel. 
PEPPER POTTS : What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying. 
TONY STARK : That's right. 
PEPPER POTTS : We got really lucky. 
TONY STARK : Yeah, I know. 
PEPPER POTTS : A lot of people didn't. 
TONY STARK : No, I can't help everybody. 
PEPPER POTTS : It sorta seems like you can. 
TONY STARK : Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop. 
PEPPER POTTS : Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life. 
[Tony smiles] 
TONY STARK : I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed. 
PEPPER POTTS : But would you be able to rest? 
[Cut to a lab in the AVenGERS Compound, we see Bruce fiddling with buttons on a panel. Scott is in his Ant-Man costume is in front of his van, with the back open to show the Quantum Tunnel. Nat and Steve are beside Bruce] 
BRUCE BANNER : Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing. 
STEVE ROGERS : Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby. 
BRUCE BANNER : Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose tiny here in the 1950s. [Scott, Nat and Cap give Bruce a panicked look] 
SCOTT LANG : Excuse me? 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : He's kidding. [In a hushed tone to Bruce] You can't say things like that! 
BRUCE BANNER : Just... It was a bad joke. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : You were kidding, right? 
BRUCE BANNER : I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. [presses a few buttons] We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense? 
SCOTT LANG : Perfectly not confusing 
STEVE ROGERS : Good luck, Scott. You got this. 
SCOTT LANG : You're right. I do, Captain America. 
BRUCE BANNER : On the count of three. 3... 2... 1! 
[Bruce presses a button, and Scott disappears into the Quantum Tunnel. In 5 seconds, Bruce presses a button, and someone in the Ant-man suit comes back. A teenager in appears out of it.] 
TEEN SCOTT LANG : Uh, guys? This...this doesn't feel right. 
STEVE ROGERS : What is this?  
BRUCE BANNER : What's going on?  
NATASHA ROMANOFF : That...who is that? 
[He pushes another couple of buttons, trying to fix the problem.]  
BRUCE BANNER : Hold on.  
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Is that Scott? 
TEEN SCOTT LANG : Yes, it's Scott! 
[Teen Scott gets sucked in back into the quantum tunnel, and it appears to be an old man in the Ant-Man suit.] 
OLD SCOTT LANG : Ow! My back! 
STEVE ROGERS : What is this? 
BRUCE BANNER : Can I get a little space here. 
STEVE ROGERS : Can you bring him back? 
BRUCE BANNER : I'm working on it! 
[After a moment, another person appears in front of them. This time, it's a baby in the Ant-Man suit.] 
STEVE ROGERS : It's a baby. 
BRUCE BANNER : It's Scott. 
STEVE ROGERS : As a baby! 
BRUCE BANNER : He'll grow! 
STEVE ROGERS : Bring Scott back. 
BRUCE BANNER : [motioning to Nat] When I say kill the power, kill the power. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Oh my god. 
BRUCE BANNER : And... Kill it! 
[Nat pulls down a lever, and everything shuts down. Scott, the normal Scott, gets spewed back out again.] 
SCOTT LANG : Somebody peed my pants. But I don't know if it was "baby" me or "old" me...Or just "me" me. 
[Bruce holds up his his hands in a dramatic way.] 
BRUCE BANNER : Time travel! 
[Steve says nothing. He simply shakes his head and walks away] 
BRUCE BANNER: What? I see this as an absolute win! 
[We cut to see Steve sitting outside the AVenGERS Compound, staring at the floor, deep in thought. He looks beat, the only possibility of victory now not an opportunity. He looks up as a deafening noise breaks the silence in the distance. As he looks, we see an Audi R8 speeding towards the entrance. The car pulls over to Cap, but goes a bit too far, then reverses to Cap. We see Tony Stark roll down the window and look at Cap] 
TONY STARK : Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby. 
STEVE ROGERS : Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here? 
[He gets out of the car, and walks around to the back.] 
TONY STARK : [Ignoring Steve's question] That's the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody shoulda cautioned you against it. 
STEVE ROGERS : You did. 
TONY STARK : Oh, did I? Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it. [He holds up his right hand, with a device on it] A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace. [Makes peace sign with his fingers] Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it. 
STEVE ROGERS : Me too. 
TONY STARK : We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice. 
STEVE ROGERS : Sounds like a deal. [Steve reaches out his hand to shake in the deal, in which Tony replies in the same way.] 
[Tony reaches back into his trunk to pull something else out, Captain America's SHIeld. He makes to give it to Steve, who hesitates.] 
STEVE ROGERS : Tony, I... 
TONY STARK : Why? I made it for you. Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding. 
[Steve fits his arm into the SHIeld.] 
STEVE ROGERS : Thank you, Tony 
TONY STARK : Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. [Hesitates] ...We are getting the whole team, yeah? 
STEVE ROGERS : We're working on that right now. 
[Cut to the Benatar landing in the yard of the Avenger's Compound. Scott is sitting having a Taco at a bench, and everything falls out of it as the Benatar lands.Nebula and Rocket walk out of the ship, and past Scott.] 
ROCKET : Hey, homie! Where's Big Green? 
SCOTT LANG : Uh, Kitchen, I think. [To himself as he sees Nebula] That's awesome. 
NEBULA : [into an earpiece] Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone. 
[She walks away. Moments later, just as Scott is getting back to his senses, Rhodey lands right in front of him without warning. This time Scott is so surprised, he drops the whole taco.] 
SCOTT LANG : Oh, God! 
RHODEY : What's up, regular sized man? 
[As Rhodey walks away, Bruce walks out of the Compound. Seeing that Scott dropped his lunch, he hands two tacos from his own lunch to Scott. Scott takes it while giving Bruce a puzzling look at this act of kindness.] 
[Cut to Bruce sitting at the back of a Utility car as they traverse the green countryside of Norway. They pass a sign labelled "NEW ASGARD". They stop at a small town on a port. Bruce and Rocket get out of the car, and look around at the remaining Asgardians, living like normal humans at a port.] 
ROCKET : Kind of a step down from a from a golden palace for an Avenger highness and whatnot. 
BRUCE BANNER : Have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home. [Bruce spots Valkyrie looking over at him, and heads over to her.] 
VALKYRIE : You shouldn't have come! 
BRUCE BANNER : Aaaaahhh Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl! 
VALKYRIE : [Noticing Bruce's change of appearance] I think I liked you better either of the other ways. 
BRUCE BANNER : [motioning to Rocket] This is Rocket. 
ROCKET : How you doin'? 
VALKYRIE : [Eyeing Rocket] He won't see you. 
BRUCE BANNER : That bad, huh? 
VALKYRIE : We only see him once a month, when he comes for... [looking over to a pile of kegs of stout and other beer on the side] ... supplies. 
ROCKET : It's that bad. 
BRUCE BANNER : Yeah. 
[Cut to Rocket opening a door, and him and Bruce walking through it.] 
BRUCE BANNER : [Grimacing at the smell] What the... 
ROCKET : Woo! Something died in here. Hello? Thor? 
THOR : [From another room.] Are you here about the cable? 
[He walks into view, and the audience's jaw drops. Thor, who is shirtless, has definitely put on more than a couple of pounds since we saw him last.] 
THOR : The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. [He notices Bruce and Rocket standing there] Boys! Oh my God! How have you been? [To Rocket, trying to hug him] Come here, you little rascal! 
ROCKET : No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary. 
THOR : Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right? 
[We see Miek and Korg sitting on a couch, PlayStation controller in hand, playing Fortnite and eating chips. 
BRUCE BANNER : Hey, long time no see. 
KORG : Hey guys. Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously. [He goes back to his game] Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again. 
THOR : Noobmaster? 
KORG : Yeah, Noobmaster69. 
[Thor walks over to Korg, takes his headphones, and speaks into the mic.] 
THOR : Noobmaster? Yeah, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms then shove them up your butt! Oh, that's right. Yes, now go cry to your father, you little weasel! 
KORG : Thank you, Thor. 
THOR : Let me know if he bothers you again, okay? 
KORG : Thank you very much. I will. 
THOR : So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things. 
[Thor uses Stormbreaker to open a bottle of beer and starts drinking. Bruce walks to him and places a hand on his shoulder] 
BRUCE BANNER : Buddy, you all right? 
THOR :  Yes, I'm fine! Why, don't I look all right? 
ROCKET : [Concerned] You look like melted ice cream. 
THOR : [Laughs] So, what's up? 
BRUCE BANNER :  We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything. 
THOR : What, like the cable? [burps] Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks. 
BRUCE BANNER : Like Thanos. 
[Thor's smile slowly disappears. He puts a shaky hand on Bruce's shoulder and points at him.] 
THOR : Don't you say that name. 
[Korg stands up and takes off his headphones] 
KORG : Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here. 
BRUCE BANNER : [quietly] Please take your hand off me. [He brushes away Thor's hand] Now, I know that... guy might scare you. 
THOR : Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off. 
[Thor walks off screen] 
KORG : Umm... Stormbreaker? 
THOR : Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker? 
BRUCE BANNER : I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it? 
THOR : I don't know. Is it... Natasha? 
BRUCE BANNER : It was you. You helped me. 
THOR : [walks over and looks out the window and points, still holding his beer] Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth. [he drops onto the sofa] The ones that are left, anyway. 
BRUCE BANNER : I think we can bring them back. 
THOR : Stop. Just, stop... [opens a packet on m&amp;ms] I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we? 
[The camera cuts to Korg and Miek eating pizza and playing once more] 
KORG : Nah, all good here, mate! 
[Cuts back to Thor] 
THOR : So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye. 
BRUCE BANNER : [from offscreen] We need you, pal. 
[Thor shakes his head and ignores Bruce] 
ROCKET : [Crossing his arms] There's beer on the ship. 
THOR : [pauses, but doesn't look up] What kind? 
THUG #1 : It's him! He's after Akihiko!
AKIHIKO : Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you!
RONIN : You survived... Half of the planet didn't. They got Thanos... you get me.
RONIN : [Also in Japanese] You're done hurting people. 
AKIHIKO : WE hurt people? You're crazy!
AKIHIKO : DIe!
AKIHIKO : Wait! Help me! I'll give you anything! What do you want?)
RONIN : [Raising his katana, in English] What I want... You can't give me. 
CLINT BARTON : You shouldn't be here. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Neither should you. 
CLINT BARTON : I've got a job to do. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back. 
[Clint starts to look emotional, on the verge of crying.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : We found something. A chance, maybe... 
CLINT BARTON : [Now openly crying] Don't... 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Don't what? 
CLINT BARTON : ...don't give me hope. 
NATASHA: I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner. 
[We cut to the Avenger's Compound, where we see Thor in a hoodie, drinking a beer and walking through the compound's Testing Chamber. Tony is also there, walking in from behind Thor.] 
TONY STARK: [To Thor] Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski. [To Rocket, who's working on something underneath a glass platform] How's it going, Ratchet? 
ROCKET : It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal. 
[Cut to a side room, where we see Scott, Bruce, Steve and Rhodey talking. Scott is in a white and red suit, similar to the Ant-Man suit.] 
RHODEY : Time travel suit? Not bad. 
SCOTT LANG : [Response to Hulk touching the suit and something red in a glass tube] Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy! 
BRUCE BANNER : I'm being very careful. 
SCOTT LANG : No, you're being very Hulky. 
BRUCE BANNER : I'm being careful. 
SCOTT LANG : [Holding up the red glass bottle] These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more. 
RHODEY : Scott, calm down! 
SCOTT LANG : Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs. [He accidentally presses a button, and shrinks, and then grows back to his normal size.] One test run. 
[Cut to the testing chamber, where we see Steve, Nat, Tony, Scott, Bruce, Rhodey and Nebula standing at a control panel, presumably controlling the glass platform.] 
SCOTT LANG : All right. I'm not ready for this. 
CLINT BARTON : I'm game. I'll do it. 
[Clint walks in wearing the suit Scott was moments before, the Quantum Suit.] 
BRUCE BANNER : Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don't worry about it. 
[Clint taking position on the platform] 
RHODEY : Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and... [he makes a hand gesture suggesting that they strangle baby Thanos with a rope] 
BRUCE BANNER : [Disgusted] First of all, that's horrible... 
RHODEY: It's Thanos. 
BRUCE BANNER : ...And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future. 
SCOTT LANG : Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved. 
CLINT BARTON : Bingo. 
NEBULA : That's not how it works. 
CLINT BARTON : Well, that's what I heard. 
BRUCE BANNER : What? By who? Who told you that? 
RHODEY : [counting with his fingers] Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time - 
SCOTT LANG : Quantum Leap - 
RHODEY : A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time - 
SCOTT LANG : Hot Tub Time Machine - 
RHODEY : Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel. 
SCOTT LANG : Die Hard? No, it's not one... 
RHODEY : This is known. 
BRUCE BANNER : I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future... 
NEBULA : Exactly. 
SCOTT LANG : So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit? 
BRUCE BANNER : [Turning to Clint] Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1! 
[A helmet similar to Ant-Man's but white and more visible face pops on Clint's head, and he goes quantum. Clint flies through the quantum realm and into an opening. He grows back to normal size, but he's at a different place, and seemingly, time.] 
[Clint look around his family home, which unlike at the start of the movie, looks a lot more alive. The helmet pops off of Clint's head, and he looks around bewildered. He sees a baseball glove on the ground, presumably belonging to one of his sons, and picks it up. We hear a noise from inside the house, someone who Clint hasn't seen for five years.] 
LILA BARTON: Cooper? Where are my headphones? 
CLINT BARTON : [murmuring] Lila? [The device on his hand starts beeping, signalling the end of this visit] Lila! [He dives for the door, but only manages to open it before he shrinks back to go back to the future.] 
[We hear footsteps coming towards where Clint has just disappeared, and we see Lila coming down the stairs in Avril Lavigne-like clothing, looking around, puzzled] 
LILA BARTON : Dad? [She looks around] Dad? 
[Lila goes back upstairs, deciding that is was just nothing] 
[Cut to the AVenGERS Compound, we see Clint rematerialise on the glass platform, breathing heavily and sitting on the platform.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay? 
CLINT BARTON : [Holding up the baseball glove] Yeah, it worked. It worked. 
[Scene cuts to the AVenGERS in a room with some hologram displays, sitting around a table. Tony, Steve and Bruce are pacing at the front, clearly leading the planning of the mission.] 
STEVE ROGERS : Okay, so the "how" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six infinity stones 
TONY STARK : Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six infinity stones. 
SCOTT LANG : I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about 
BRUCE BANNER : Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history. 
TONY STARK : Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in. 
CLINT BARTON : Which means we have to pick our targets. 
TONY STARK : Correct. 
STEVE ROGERS : Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know? 
[We see Thor sitting on a chair with his sunglasses on. It is impossible to tell whether he is awake or asleep.] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Is he asleep? 
RHODEY : No. I'm pretty sure he's dead. 
[Thor wakes up] 
THOR : Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... and angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago...My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves... [He wiggles his fingers to imitate a spooky ghost] Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane, [An image of Jane Foster pops up on the screen] Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead, [Thor starts to look broken, and seems on the verge of tears] and oh you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever, [Tony starts to push him back to his chair] I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence. 
TONY STARK : Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast? 
THOR : I'd like a Bloody Mary, thank you. 
[Cut to the AVenGERS sitting around a table, eating a meal, and Rocket is pacing on the table in front of everyone.] 
ROCKET : Quill said he stole the power stone from Morag. 
SCOTT LANG : Is that a person? 
ROCKET : Morag's a planet. Quill was a person. 
SCOTT LANG : A planet? Like in outer space? 
ROCKET : Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything. [Imitating talking to a puppy] Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I'll take you to space. 
[Cut to everyone facing Nebula in the planning room, and Nat writing notes for their plan.] 
NEBULA : Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : [In a business-like tone] What is Vormir? 
NEBULA : A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos murdered my sister. 
[Nat looks up, and an awkward silence falls upon the room. She writes what Nebula has just said, and Scott makes to break the awkward moment.] 
SCOTT LANG : Not it. 
[We see Tony and Nat lying on a table surrounded by papers, and Bruce lying down on the floor.]  
NATASHA ROMANOFF : That Time Stone guy... 
BRUCE BANNER : Doctor Strange. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Yeah, what kind of doctor was he? 
TONY STARK : Neurostuff meets rabbit from a hat. Nice place in the village, though. 
BRUCE: Yeah. Sullivan Street. Hmm... Bleecker. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Wait, he lived in New York? 
TONY STARK : No. He lived in Toronto.  
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York. 
BRUCE BANNER : [Sitting up in surprise] Shut the front door! 
[Shot cuts to the holograms displaying the different location, the Soul and Power stones in space in 2014. the Reality stone in Asgard, 2013; and the Space, Mind, and Time stones in New York City 2012] 
STEVE ROGERS : All right. We have a plan. Six stones, three teams. One shot. 
[He and the other AVenGERS walk up and look at the screens determinedly.] 
[The shot cuts to the AVenGERS walking in a file to the Quantum Time machine, wearing the Quantum Suits, albeit with some minor differences for different people. Rhodey has a bulkier repaint of the War machine armour. ] 
STEVE ROGERS : Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect.  Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win. [Tony gives Steve a look] Whatever it takes. Good luck. 
ROCKET : He's pretty good at that. 
SCOTT LANG : Right? 
TONY STARK : All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green. 
BRUCE BANNER : Tractors engaged. 
ROCKET : [Addressing the shrunk Benatar in Clint's hand] You promise to bring that back in one piece, right? 
CLINT BARTON : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best. 
ROCKET : As promises go, that was pretty lame. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : [Smiling excitedly] See you in a minute. 
[They all shrink and enter the Quantum Realm, and they all split at different intervals, going to a different place at a different time in history.] 
[The First Group which has Tony, Steve, Bruce, &amp; Scott; Travels to New York in 2012] 
STEVE ROGERS : All right, we all have our assignments. Two stones uptown, one stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock. 
[2012 Hulk passes by them, smashing everything in his way. Bruce puts his hand on his face, embarrassed.] 
STEVE ROGERS : Feel free to smash if things along the way. 
BRUCE BANNER : I think it's gratuitous, but whatever. 
[Present Bruce pretends to smash things in a sarcastic way. He tears his shirt off, and walks over to a car. He lightly punches the car, making a small dent, all the while making growling noises. He picks up a motorbike and throws it at a wall, wincing as it hits the wall.] 
[Shot cuts to the Roof of the Sanctum Sanctorum where 2012 The Ancient One protects it. Bruce tries to enter through the roof before noticing her] 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012) : I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed. 
BRUCE BANNER : Ma'am, I'm looking for Doctor Strange. 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012) : You're about... five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about twenty blocks that way. What do you want from him? 
BRUCE BANNER : That, actually. 
[He points towards the Eye of Agamotto where the time stone is kept] 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012) : Ah. I'm afraid not. 
BRUCE BANNER : Sorry, but I wasn't asking. 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012) : You don't wanna do this. 
BRUCE BANNER : Ah, you're right, I don't. [He makes a grab at the Eye of Agamotto] But I need that stone, and I don't have time to beat it- 
[The Ancient One (2012) pushes Bruce' astral form out of his body. Bruce who's is now in astral form looks at The Ancient One horrified.] 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012) : Let's start over, shall we? 
[Cut to an aerial shot of Asgard in 2013.Then to the prison in Asgard, where we see the Loki from The Dark World, sitting in his cell. Without him noticing, Rocket and Thor creep by, past the cell. They stop at a pillar a few metres away room of where Jane Foster is] 
THOR : That's Jane. 
ROCKET : All right. Here's the deal, Tubby: You're gonna charm her and I'm gonna poke her with this thing, [He holds up a device.] and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split. 
THOR : I'll be right back, okay? There's a wine cellar, that's just down there. My father used to fish huge barrel of ale. I'll see if the cellar has a couple of... 
ROCKET : Hey! Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already? 
[A door opens, Thor and Rocket both try to hide. We then see ladies along with Frigga (2013) walking. Thor sees his mother.] 
ROCKET : Who's the fancy broad? 
THOR : It's my Mother. She dies today. 
ROCKET : Oh. That's today? 
THOR : I can't do this. I can't do this. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.This was a bad idea. 
ROCKET : Come here. 
THOR : No, no, no. I think I'm having...I'm having a panic attack. I shouldn't be here...this is...this is a bad- 
ROCKET : Come here. Right here. 
[Rocket slaps Thor] 
ROCKET : You think you're the only one who lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she's gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back? 
THOR : Okay. 
ROCKET : Are you crying? 
THOR : No...Yes! 
ROCKET : Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right? 
THOR : Yes, I can. 
ROCKET : Good. 
THOR : I can do this. I can do it I can't do this. 
[Thor runs away] 
ROCKET : Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot. [He turns back to where Thor was moments ago] Thor? Thor! 
[Cut to Morag in 2014, where we see Rhodey getting off the Benatar as it lands.] 
RHODEY : Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That's it. Down, down. 
CLINT BARTON : Hey, can we hurry it up? 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on a clock. 
[Nebula walks out of the ship, apparently having directed it to its next destination. 
CLINT BARTON : All that, is really helpful. 
RHODEY : [Hugging Natasha] Take care, okay? 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Yeah. 
RHODEY : Take that stone and come back. No messing around. 
CLINT BARTON : [To Rhodey] Hey. You got this. 
RHODEY : Let's get it done. Yes, sir. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF : [Walking with Clint back into the ship] See you back. 
RHODEY : You guys watch each other's six. 
[Clint and Nat look back and just smile.] 
CLINT BARTON : Yeah. 
[They walk back into the ship, and the hatch closes. The ship takes off and speeds out of the atmosphere of Morag.] 
NEBULA : The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out. 
[In the Benatar, Clint and Nat are sitting at the front of the ship. The ship takes a jump through space and speeds up tremendously. Nat and Clint look at each other.] 
CLINT BARTON : We're a long way from Budapest. 
[Natasha just laughs.] 
[Back to Morag, where Rhodey and Nebula are standing where we left them.] 
RHODEY : Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it? 
NEBULA : [Looking around] Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones. 
RHODEY : Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones? 
NEBULA : My father, my sister... and me. 
RHODEY : And you? Where are you right now? 
[Cuts to a scene of Gamora (2014) and Nebula (2014) fighting some intergalactic creatures] 
GAMORA (2014) : [Helping Nebula up] You're welcome. 
NEBULA (2014) : I didn't ask for your help. 
GAMORA (2014) : And yet, you always need it. Get up. Father wants us back on the ship. 
NEBULA (2014) : Why? 
GAMORA (2014) : He's found an Infinity Stone. 
(NEBULA (2014) : Where? 
GAMORA (2014) : On a planet called Morag. 
NEBULA (2014) : Father's plan is finally in motion. 
GAMORA (2014) : One stone isn't six, Nebula. 
NEBULA (2014) : It’s a start. 
GAMORA (2014) : If he gets all of them... 
[Thanos (2014) arrives] 
THANOS (2014) : Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship. 
GAMORA (2014) : He won't like that. 
THANOS (2014) : His alternative is death, then. [Thanos wipes his double-bladed sword] Ronan's obsession clouds his judgement. 
NEBULA (2014) : We will not fail you, Father. 
[Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes] 
THANOS (2014) : No, you won't. 
NEBULA (2014) : I swear...I will make you proud. 
[Nebula (2014) is suddenly in pain and opens up future Nebula's memories] 
RHODEY (Memory) : We just, wait around for this Quill guy to show up, and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it? 
NEBULA (Memory) : Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones. 
[Nebula (2014) shuts off the memory] 
GAMORA (2014) : Who was that? 
NEBULA (2014) : I don't know...My head is splitting...I don't know... 
GAMORA (2014) : Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle. 
[Thanos walks towards Nebula and brings his blade to her throat] 
THANOS (2014) : Ssshhh... (pointing to Nebula) Bring her to my ship. 
[Cut to present Tony Stark flying around Stark Tower in the Mark 85. He scans the interior of the tower, and sees the original AVenGERS apprehending Loki, the backside of the iconic shot of Hawkeye pointing the bow at Loki's face while the AVenGERS surround him.] 
TONY STARK : Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here. 
[Cut to Steve in Stark Tower, walking towards the elevator.] 
STEVE ROGERS : Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now. 
LOKI (2012) : If it's all the same to you... I'll have that drink now. 
TONY STARK (2012) : All right. Good one. No standing around, I'm closing up this door for later. [To 2012 Cap] By the way, feel free to clean up. 
TONY STARK : Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit [A shot of Cap walking around in his 2012 suit] did nothing for your ass. 
STEVE ROGERS : No one asked you to look, Tony. 
SCOTT LANG : I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass. [Does a patriotic salute] 
NATASHA ROMANOFF (2012) : Uhh, magic wand? 
TONY STARK (2012) : STRIKE team's coming to secure it. 
[A Hydra team including Rumlow and Sitwell enter, known at this time as a part of SHIeld.] 
SITWELL (2012) : We can take that [Taking Loki's Scepter from 2012 Natasha] off your hands. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF (2012) : By all means. Careful with that thing. 
CLINT BARTON (2012) : Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way. 
SITWELL (2012) : We promise to be careful. 
SCOTT LANG : Who are these guys? 
TONY STARK : They are SHIeld...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet. 
SCOTT LANG : Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys. 
TONY STARK : You're small, but you're talking loud. 
STEVE ROGERS (2012) : On my way down to coordinate search and rescue. 
LOKI (2012) : [Transforming into Steve for a second in imitation] On my way down to coordinate search and rescue! [Transforming back] I mean, honestly! How do you think you'll be... 
THOR (2012) : [Slapping on a device on Loki's mouth to make him quiet] Shut up. 
TONY STARK : All right, you're up, little buddy. [Looking at the briefcase with the Tesseract] There's our stone. 
SCOTT LANG : [Lying down on Tony's shoulder] Alright. Flick me. 
[Tony flicks Scott onto his 2012 self, right into his beard. 2012 Tony then scratches his beard, dropping present Scott onto 2012 Tony's reactor.]  
[All of the 2012 AVenGERS get in an elevator. Hulk makes to follow, but finds the elevator full.] 
TONY STARK (2012): Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Hey! Buddy. What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached. 
CLINT BARTON (2012): Take the stairs. 
TONY STARK (2012): Yeah. [Hulk draws his fist back right as the elevator door closes] Stop. Stop! 
[He follows through with the punch, making a dent in the wall right where the door was.] 
HULK (2012) : [Pissed] Take the stairs.Take the stairs! 
TONY STARK : All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor. 
STEVE ROGERS : On it. Head to the lobby. 
TONY STARK : Alright. I'll see you there. 
[scene cuts to HYDRA agents in the elevator] 
SITWELL (2012) : Evidence secure. We're en route to Dr. List. No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary. 
[elavator opens and HYDRA agents sees Steve] 
SITWELL (2012): Captain. I thought you were coordinating search and rescue? 
STEVE: Change of plans. 
RUMLOW (2012) : Hey, Cap. 
STEVE ROGERS : Rumlow. [everyone starts getting suspicious and has their guard up] I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter. 
SITWELL (2012) : Sir? I don't understand. 
STEVE ROGERS : We got word there may be an attempt to steal it. 
RUMLOW (2012) : Sorry, Cap. I can't give you the scepter. 
SITWELL (2012) : I'm gonna have to call the Director. 
STEVE ROGERS : That's okay. Trust me. [Steve leans over to Sitwell's ear] Hail Hydra. 
[Everyone is surprised, Steve walks out of the elevator with the scepter and a smile] 
[Cut to the building's stairwell. The Hulk looks down at the may stairs below him.] 
HULK (2012) : [Angrily] So many stairs! 
[Cut to the lobby. The 2012 AVenGERS start to make their way out of the building. Tony and Scott eye them undercover] 
TONY STARK : Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time. 
SCOTT LANG : Bombs away. Is, is that Axe body spray? 
TONY STARK : Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please? 
SCOTT LANG : I'm going inside you. Now. 
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012) : May I ask you where you're going? 
THOR (2012) : To lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are? 
TONY STARK (2012) : Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one of the folks behind Nick Fury. 
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012) : My friends call me Mr. Secretary. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me. 
THOR (2012) : Loki will be answering to Odin himself. 
ALEXANDER PEIRCE (2012) : Oh, he's gonna answer to us. Odin can have what's left. And I'm gonna need that case, that's been SHIeld property for over 70 years. 
HYDRA AGENT: Hand over the case, Stark. 
TONY STARK : [To present Scott through radio] All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go. 
TONY STARK(2012) : I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here, all right? 
SCOTT LANG : You promise me you won't die? 
TONY STARK : You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia. 
SCOTT LANG : That doesn't sound mild. 
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012) : I need the case. 
TONY STARK (2012) : I know you got a lotta pull. I'm just saying... 
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012) : Okay. Then give me the case. 
TONY STARK : Do it, Lang! 
TONY STARK (2012) : Get your hands off! 
TONY STARK : Window's closing. Pull my pin! 
SCOTT LANG : Here goes! 
[Ant-Man pulls off Stark 2012's reactor, and Tony (2012) drops the case] 
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012) : Stark? Stark! 
[Stark 2012 falls down to the ground] 
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012) : Look, he's convulsing. Give him air! Medic! 
TONY STARK(dress as a SHIeld agent): MEDIC! You guys, some help! 
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012) : Stark, you--- your chest machine? 
[Ant-Man pushes the case, Loki looks at case, Tony Stark grabs the case.] 
TONY STARK(dress as a SHIeld agent) : Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice. 
[Suddenly, Hulk 2012 pushes Tony to the ground and the Tesseract slides to Loki] 
HULK (2012) : NO MORE STAIRS!!!! 
[Everyone runs from Hulk's rampage, Loki 2012 grabs the Tesseract and teleports it away] 
THOR (2012) : You'll be fine, Stark. Stay with us! I'll try something, okay? I have no idea if it's gonna work. 
[Thor 2012 uses the Mjolnir as the defibrillator on Tony Stark 2012] 
THOR (2012) : YES! 
TONY STARK (2012) : That worked a treat. That was so crazy! 
THOR (2012) : I had no idea if that was gonna work. 
TONY (2012) : The case? 
THOR (2012) : The case. It's, uhh... Where's the case? Where's Loki? Loki! 
SCOTT LANG : That wasn't supposed to happen, was it? 
TONY STARK : Oh, we blew it. 
THOR (2012) : Loki! 
[Cut to a walkway several floors up. Steve is having trouble on his communicator] 
STEVE: Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube. [He looks up and groans] Oh, you gotta be shitting me. 
[In front of him, Steve sees his 2012 self looking back] 
STEVE (2012): I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor. 
STEVE: [Puts the case down] I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you. 
[2012 Steve engages and the two Captain Americas begin to duel] 
STEVE (2012): I can do this all day. 
STEVE: Yeah, I know. I know. 
[Future Steve's locket of Peggy falls out, Steve (2012) notices it] 
STEVE (2012): Where did you get this? 
[Steve (2012) has future Steve in a chokehold] 
STEVE: Bucky... is... alive! 
STEVE (2012): What? 
[Future Steve takes the chance to knock Steve (2012), gets up and stares at him] 
STEVE: That really is America's ass. 
[Scene cuts back to Bruce and The Ancient One (2012). Bruce Banner tries reasoning with the Ancient One to let him have the Time Stone] 
BRUCE: Please, please! 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality, I'm dooming my own. 
BRUCE: With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that. 
[The Ancient One creates a projection with a long ray that simulates the flow of time.] 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. Remove one stone and that flow splits. [Shows black stream indicating a point of divergence] Now, this may benefit your reality, but my new one…not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So, tell me, Doctor, can your science prevent all that? 
BRUCE: No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, in that reality, it never left. 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): But you are leaving out the most important part. In order to return the stones, you have to survive. 
BRUCE: We will. I will. I promise. 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I can't risk this Reality on a promise. It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone. 
BRUCE: Then, why the hell did Strange give it away? 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): [Surprised] What did you say? 
BRUCE: Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos. 
THE ANCINET ONE (2012): Willingly? 
BRUCE: Yes. 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): ...Why? 
BRUCE; I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake. 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Or I did. [She returns to Banner control of his Hulk body and opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone] Strange is meant to be the best of us. 
BRUCE: So he must have done it for a reason. 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I fear you might be right. [gives him the Time Stone] 
BRUCE: Thank you. 
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'm counting on you, Bruce. We all are. 
[Cut to Thanos (2014), Nebula (2014), Gamora (2014) and Ebony Maw (2014) on Vormir] 
THANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw]  Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file. 
EBONY MAW (2014): Sire, the file appears entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There's another consciousness sharing her network...another Nebula. 
GAMORA (2014):  Impossible. 
EBONY MAW (2014):  This duplicate carries a time stamp... from nine years in the future. 
THANOS (2014): Where is this other Nebula? 
EBONY MAW (2014):  In our solar system. On Morag. 
THANOS (2014): Can you access her? 
EBONY MAW (2014): Yes. The two are linked. 
THANOS (2014): Search the duplicate's memories for Infinity Stones. 
[Memory of the meeting with all the AVenGERS starts playing] 
STEVE (2023): And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history. 
TONY (2023): Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in. 
TONY (2023):  Which means we have to pick our targets. - Correct. 
[End memory] 
THANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw]  Freeze image. 
GAMORA (2014): Terrans. 
THANOS (2014): AVenGERS. Unruly wretches. What's that reflection? Amplify this, Maw. 
GAMORA (2014): [Looking at a reflection of Nebula (2023)] I don't understand. Two Nebulas. 
THANOS (2014): No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories. I want to see everything. 
[Cut back to Thor and Rocket in Asgard, 2013] 
FRIGGA (2013):  My ladies, I'll see you after. Go on. [To Thor] What are you doing? 
THOR: Ahh! 
FRIGGA (2013): You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother. 
THOR:  Yeah, I was simply just going for a walk, and uh... 
FRIGGA (2013):  What are you wearing? 
THOR: I always wear this. This is one of my favorites. 
[Frigga puts her hand on Thor's face and takes a good look at him} 
FRIGGA (2013): What's wrong with your eye? 
THOR: Oh, my eye. That's... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword? 
FRIGGA (2013):  You're not the Thor I know at all, are you? 
THOR: Yes, I am. 
FRIGGA (2013):  The future hasn't been kind to you, has it? 
THOR: I didn't say I'm from the future. 
FRIGGA (2013): I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, and you know that. 
[Thor attempts to hold back his tears and fails miserably] 
THOR: I am totally, totally from the future! 
FRIGGA (2013): Yes, you are. 
THOR: I really need to talk to you. 
FRIGGA (2013): We can talk. 
[They both hug each other] 
[Scene cuts to Jane Foster waking up while Rocket sneaks behind her to extract the Aether]  
[Scene cuts back to Thor and Frigga's conversation] 
THOR: His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe. 
FRIGGA (2013): You're no idiot. You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard. 
THOR: I guess, yeah. 
FRIGGA (2013): Idiot? No. A failure? Absolutely. 
THOR: That's a little bit harsh. 
FRIGGA (2013):  You do know what that makes you? Just like everyone else. 
THOR: I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I? 
FRIGGA (2013):  Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be, Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are. 
THOR: I really missed you, Mum. 
[scene cuts to Rocket running away from the Asgardian soldiers] 
ROCKET: Thor! I got it! 
ASGARDIAN SOLDIER (2013):  Get that rabbit! 
THOR: Ma, I have to tell you something. 
FRIGGA (2013): No, son. You don't. You're here to repair your future, not mine. 
THOR: But this is about your future. 
FRIGGA (2013): It's none of my business. 
ROCKET: Hey. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we got to move. 
THOR: I wish we had more time. 
FRIGGA (2013): No, this was a gift. And you're going to be the man you're meant to be. 
THOR: I love you, Mom. 
FRIGGA (2013): I love you. And eat a salad. 
ROCKET: Come on. We gotta go.  
FRIGGA (2013): [whispers] Goodbye. 
ROCKET: Three... two... 
THOR: No, wait! 
[Thor holds out his hand] 
ROCKET: Wh- what am I looking at? 
FRIGGA (2013): Oh, sometimes it takes a second. 
[Thor summons Mjolnir] 
THOR: I'm still worthy. 
["Come And Get Your Love" starts playing in the background] 
ROCKET: Oh, boy. 
THOR: Goodbye, Mom. 
FRIGGA (2013): [whispers] Goodbye. 
[Scene cuts to Quill on Morag dancing to "Come And Get Your Love", we then pan over to Rhodey and Nebula hiding in the background watching Quill dance to their perspective without music]  
RHODEY: So he's an idiot? 
NEBULA: Yeah. 
[Rhodey knocks out Quill and Nebula rummages around to take Quill's tool] 
RHODEY: What's that? 
NEBULA: The tool of a thief. 
[Nebula uses the tool to open the door that leads to The Orb A.K.A The Power Stone. Nebula tries to walk in but is stopped by Rhodey] 
RHODEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...This is the part where spikes come out with skeletons on the end and everything... 
NEBULA: What are you talking about? 
RHODEY: When you break into a place called the temple of the Power Stone, There's gonna be a bunch of boobytraps--- 
[Nebula just shakes her head and walks in] 
RHODEY: Okay. All right. Go ahead. 
[Nebula forces her hand inside the force field protecting The Orb while it melts away the exteriro plating on her arm. She successfully retrieves The Orb and hands it to Rhodey all the while Rhodey watched the whole thing happened] 
NEBULA: I wasn't always like this. 
RHODEY: Me either. But we work with what we got, right? 
[The just both look at each other solemnly] 
RHODEY: Sync up. [They both suit up] Three.. two.. one... 
[Rhodey is the only one who disappears while Nebula is left behind unable to move, then she riddled with pain on her head] 
[A memory is played, coming from future Nebulas head] 
BRUCE (Memory): You murdered trillions! 
THANOS (Memory): You should be grateful. 
NATASHA (Memory): Where are the stones? 
THANOS (Memory): Gone. Reduced to atoms. 
BRUCE (Memory): You used them two days ago. 
THANOS (Memory): I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. I am inevitable. 
[Memory pauses] 
GAMORA (2014): What did you do to them? 
THANOS (2014) Nothing. Yet. They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs. 
GAMORA (2014): The stones... 
THANOS (2014): I found them all. I won. Tipped the cosmic scales to balance. 
[Thanos (2014) caress Gamora (2014) and she kneels down] 
MAW (2014): This is your future. 
THANOS (2014): It's my destiny. 
[Maw resumes playing the memory] 
NEBULA (Memory):  My father is many things. A liar is not one of them. 
THANOS (Memory): Thank you, Daughter. Perhaps I treated you too harshly... 
[Thanos gets beheaded in the memory, Gamora (2014) is shocked and stands up] 
THANOS (2014):  And that, is destiny fulfilled. 
MAW (2014): Sire, your Daughter... 
[Maw (2014) telekinetically wraps a chain around Nebula (2014)] 
NEBULA (2014): No... 
MAW (2014): ...is a traitor. 
NEBULA (2014): That's not me. It's not. I could never... I would never betray you. Never. 
[Thanos (2014) releases the chain around Nebula (2014) neck and holds her head in his palm] 
THANOS (2014): I know. And you'll have the chance to prove it. 
[Thanos (2014) makes Nebula not allowed to travel back to 2023. Nebula is stuck in 2014] 
NEBULA: No... 
NEBULA: He knows! 
NEBULA: Barton? Barton, come in. 
NEBULA: Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem. Come on! 
NEBULA: Come in, we have a prob.... 
NEBULA: Thanos knows. 
NEBULA: Thanos... 
[The scene cuts to Steve, who has just defeated himself. Jumping down from building with the sceptor] 
TONY: Cap... 
[He turns around to see Tony and Scott sitting in a broken car] 
TONY: Sorry, buddy. We got a problem. 
SCOTT: Huh. Yeah, we do. 
STEVE: Well, what are we gonna do now? 
TONY: You know what, give me a break, Steve. 
TONY:  I just got hit in the head with a Hulk. 
SCOTT: You said that we had one shot. This, this was our shot. 
SCOTT:We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing. 
TONY: You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself. 
SCOTT:You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself. 
SCOTT: No! 
TONY: Come on. 
SCOTT: You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist... 
TONY: I dropped the ball. 
SCOTT: You ruined the time heist. 
TONY: Is that what I did? 
SCOTT: Yeah! 
STEVE: Are there any other options with the Tesseract? 
SCOTT; No, no, no. There's no other options. 
SCOTT: There's no do-overs. We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. Each. 
SCOTT: That's it, alright? We use that... Bye, bye. You're not going home. 
STEVE: Yeah, well if we don't try... 
STEVE: then no one else is going home, either. 
TONY: I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. 
TONY: We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State. 
STEVE: When were they both there? 
TONY: They were there at a... I've a vaguely exact idea. 
STEVE:  How vague? 
SCOTT:  What are you talking about? Where are we going? 
TONY: I know for a fact they were there... 
SCOTT: Who's they? What are we doing? 
TONY: And I know how I know. 
SCOTT: Guys, what's up? What is it? 
STEVE:  Well, it looks like we're improvising. 
SCOTT: Right. What are we improvising? 
STEVE:  Scott, get this back to the compound. 
TONY: Suit up. 
SCOTT: What's in New Jersey? 
TONY: 0-4
STEVE: 0-4… 
TONY: 0-7. 
STEVE: 0-7. 
SCOTT: Excuse me... 
TONY:  1-9-7-0. 
STEVE: Are you sure? 
SCOTT: Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look, if you do this, and this doesn't work, you're not coming back. 
TONY:  Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. 
TONY: [To Steve]  You trust me? 
STEVE:  I do. 
TONY:  Your call. 
STEVE:  Here we go. 
[Cut to Steve and Tony in New Jersey, 1970] 
STAN LEE: [Driving past Steve and Tony] Hey, man. Make love, not war! 
TONY: Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right? 
STEVE: The idea of me was. 
TONY: Right. Well, imagine you're SHIeld, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it? 
STEVE:  In plain sight. 
[Tony and Steve are in an elevator with a lady] 
TONY: [Leaving the elevator] Good luck on your mission, Captain. 
STEVE: [Waiting for another floor]  Good luck on your project, doctor. 
ELEVATOR LADY:  You're new here? 
STEVE: Not exactly. 
[Cut to Tony in what seems to be a lab area and he is looking for the tesseract] 
TONY: [Grabbing Tesseract]  Gotcha. 
TONY:  Back in the game. 
HOWARD STARK:  Arnim, you in there? Arnim? 
HOWARD STARK: Hey! The door's this way, pal. 
TONY: Oh, yeah. 
HOWARD STARK: I'm looking for Dr. Zola. Have you seen him? 
TONY:  Yeah, no, Dr. Zol... No, I haven't seen a soul. 
HOWARD STARK: Pardon me. Do I know you? 
TONY: No, sir. I'm, a... visitor from MIT. 
HOWARD STARK: Huh. MIT. Got a name? 
TONY: Uh...Howard. 
HOWARD STARK: Well, that'll be easy to remember. 
TONY: Howard....Potts. 
HOWARD STARK:   Well, I'm Howard Stark. 
TONY: Hi. 
HOWARD STARK:  Shit. Now, don't pull it. 
TONY: Yeah... 
HOWARD STARK: You look a little green around the gills there, Potts. 
TONY: I'm fine. Just, long hours. 
HOWARD STARK:  Wanna get some air? 
HOWARD STARK: Hello Potts 
TONY: Yeah. That would be swell. 
HOWARD STARK: That way. 
Tony: Okay. 
HOWARD STARK: Need your briefcase? 
HOWARD STARK: You're not one of those, are ya, Potts? 
[cut to Dr Pym who is younger] 
Captain Stevens: Hello. Dr. Pym? 
Dr Pym: That would be the number that you called. Yes. 
Captain Stevens: This is Capt. Stevens from shipping. 
Captain Stevens: We have a package for you. 
Dr Pym:Bring it up. 
Captain Stevens: Well, that's the thing, sir. We can't. 
Dr Pym: I'm confused. I thought that was your job. 
Captain Stevens: Well, it's just... Sir, the box is glowing and, 
Captain Stevens: to be honest, some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great. 
Dr Pym: They didn't know better, did they? 
Captain Stevens: Yeah, they did. You better get down here. 
Dr Pym: Excuse me. Out of the way! 
[cut back to Howard and Tony] 
TONY: So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight? 
HOWARD STARK: My wife's expecting. 
HOWARD STARK: And, uh... Too much time in the office. 
TONY: Congratulations. 
HOWARD STARK: Thanks. Hold this, will you? 
TONY: Yeah, sure. 
TONY: How far along is she? 
HOWARD STARK:- I don't know... uh... 
HOWARD STARK: She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. 
HOWARD STARK: guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again. 
TONY: I have a little girl. 
HOWARD STARK: a girl would be nice. Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me. 
TONY: What'd be so awful about that? 
HOWARD STARK: Let's just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed 
HOWARD STARK: my own self-interests. 
[cut to elevator lady talking to security guards about Tony and Captain America looking fishy] 
SECURITY OFFICER: And you've never seen these 2 men before? 
ELEVATOR LADY: No, I've got an eye for this. 
ELEVATOR LADY: The 2 of them looked fishy. 
SECURITY OFFICER: Can you describe them? 
ELEVATOR LADY: Well, one of them had a hippie beard. 
SECURITY OFFICER: Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry? 
ELEVATOR LADY: Definitely Mungo Jerry. 
SECURITY OFFICER: Yeah, this is Chesler. I need every available MPs 
SECURITY OFFICER: on sub-level 6. We have a potential breach. 
[Tony and Howard still talking to each other] 
TONY: So, where are you at with names? 
HOWARD STARK: Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Almanzo. 
TONY: Might wanna let that stew on. You got time. 
HOWARD STARK: Let me ask you a question. 
HOWARD STARK: When your kid was born... 
HOWARD STARK: were you nervous? 
TONY: Wildly. Yeah. 
HOWARD STARK: Did you feel qualified? 
HOWARD STARK: Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? 
TONY: I literally pieced it together as I went along, 
TONY: I thought about what my Dad did, and... 
TONY: My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. 
TONY: I thought my Dad was tough on me. 
TONY: And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. 
TONY:- He did drop the odd pearl. 
HOWARD STARK: Yeah? Like what? 
TONY: "No amount of money ever bought a second of time." 
HOWARD STARK: Smart guy. 
TONY: He did his best. 
HOWARD STARK: Let me tell you. That kid's not even here yet 
HOWARD STARK: and, there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. 
HOWARD STARK: Good to meet you, Potts. 
TONY: Yeah, Howard... 
TONY: Everything's gonna be all right. 
TONY: Thank you for everything... 
TONY: ...you've done for this country. 
HOWARD STARK: Jarvis, Have we ever met that guy? 
EDWIN JARVIS: You know a lot of people, sir. 
HOWARD STARK: Seems very familiar. 
HOWARD STARK: Weird beard, though 
[2014 Nebula has captured 2023 Nebula and 2014 Nebula is fighting of her future self] 
2014 NEBULA: You're weak. 
NEBULA: I'm you. 
NEBULA: You can stop this. You know you want to. Did you see what happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone. You wanna know how he does that? You wanna know, what he does to you? 
2014 NEBULA: That's enough. You disgust me. But, that doesn't mean you're useless. How do I look? 
[Scene cuts to Vomir 2014 where Natasha and Clint arrives]. 
CLINT: Wow... Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome. 
[Natasha and Clint starts walking towards the mountain and climbed it] 
NATASHA:  I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain. 
CLINT:  Technically, he's not a raccoon, you know. 
NATASHA:  Whatever. He eats garbage 
RED SKULL (2014): Welcome. 
[Natasha and Clint draws their weapons] 
RED SKULL (2014):  Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith. 
NATASHA: Who are you? 
RED SKULL (2014): Consider me a guide. To you, and to all who seek the Soul Stone. 
NATASHA: Oh good. You tell us where it is. Then we'll be on our way. 
RED SKULL (2014): If only it were that easy. 
[Stonkeeper leads Clint and Natasha to the cliff] 
RED SKULL (2014): What you seek lies in front of you......as does what you fear. 
NATASHA: The stone is down there. 
RED SKULL (2014):  For one of you. For the other... In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul. 
[scene cuts to Natasha sitting on a log while Clint watches the Stonekeeper] 
CLINT: How's it going? Jesus...Maybe he's making this shit up. 
NATASHA: No. I don't think so. 
CLINT: Why, 'cause he knows your Daddy's name? 
NATASHA: I didn't. Thanos left here with the stone without his daughter. It's not a coincidence. 
CLINT: Yeah. 
NATASHA: Whatever it takes. 
CLINT: Whatever it takes. 
[Natasha stands up] 
NATASHA: If we don't get that stone,billions of people stay dead. 
CLINT:  Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be. 
NATASHA:  I guess we do. 
[Clint holds Natasha's hand and she reciprocates and they look at each other] 
CLINT:  I'm starting to think, we've been different people here, Natasha. 
NATASHA: For the last five years I've been trying to do one thing: Get to right here. That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back. 
CLINT: Oh, don't you get all decent on me now. 
NATASHA: What, you think I wanna do it? I'm trying to save your life, you idiot. 
CLINT:  Yeah well, I don't want you to, because I...Natasha, you know what I've done. You know what I've become. 
NATASHA: I don't judge people on their worst mistakes. 
CLINT:  Maybe you should. 
NATASHA:  You didn't. 
CLINT:  You're a pain in my ass, you know that? 
[Both Clint and Natasha lean their heads against each other] 
CLINT: Okay. You win. 
[Clint smiles and knocks Natasha to the ground] 
CLINT:  Tell my family I love them. 
[Natasha returns the favor by tackling Clint to the ground] 
NATASHA:   You tell them yourself. 
[Natasha electrocutes Clint and she runs towards the cliff. Clint gets up and shoots an explosive arrow knocking her down. Clint then runs towards the cliff and jumps. Natasha jumps after him and hooks him up to a grappling hook] 
CLINT:  Damn you! 
NATASHA:  Let me go. 
CLINT:  No.  Please, no 
NATASHA:  It's okay. 
CLINT:  Please... 
[Cut to the AVenGERS HQ and the Quantum platform everyone looks around to see all the recovered stones] 
BRUCE:  Did we get them all? 
RHODEY: You telling me this'll actually work? 
[There's a pause as everyone starts to realise someone is missing] 
BRUCE:  Clint, where's Nat? 
[The silence from Clint tells them all they need to know. The mission was completed but at a dire cost. Sadness overtakes everyone. Bruce falls to his knees and pounds the floor in grief.] 
[Cut to outside HQ. Lakeside, Tony, Steve, Thor, Clint, and Bruce are mourning their fallen teammate and friend] 
TONY: Do we know if she had family? 
STEVE: Yeah. Us. 
THOR: (confused) What? 
TONY: I just asked him a question... 
THOR: Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right? So stop this shit. We're the AVenGERS, get it together. 
CLINT: We can't get her back. 
THOR: Wha- what? 
CLINT: It can't be undone. It can't. 
[Thor dryly laughs] 
THOR: I'm sorry. No offense, but you're a very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And "can't" seems very definitive don't you think? 
CLINT: (to Thor) Look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she? 
THOR: Now that's my point... 
CLINT: It can't... be undone. Or that's at least what the, great floating guy had to say. (shouts) Maybe you wanna go talk to him? Okay? Go grab your hammer, and you go fly and you talk to him. 
[Clint's anger is quickly replaced with grief] 
CLINT: It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamned stone. She bet her life on it. 
[In a burst of anger, Bruce grabs a bench and hurls it clear across the lake. His anger spent, he turns to the others with a resigned look on his face] 
BRUCE: She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to. 
STEVE: We will. 
[Cut to inside the Avenger's Lab. Tony carefully places the stones in the gauntlet he made while Bruce and Rocket watches. With nervous precision, Tony manipulates the machine and carefully places all six stones into the gauntlet] 
ROCKET: Boom! 
[Tony and Bruce jump a bit, and quickly groan at Rocket's joke. Scene cuts to another room with the new finished gauntlet. Everyone is gathered around it.] 
ROCKET: All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers? 
THOR: I'll do it. 
SCOTT: Excuse me?  
THOR: It's okay. 
EVERYONE: (holding up Thor) No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey... 
STEVE: Wait, wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet. 
THOR: Oh,  I'm sorry. What, were you just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity? 
SCOTT: We should at least discuss it. 
THOR: Look, us sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty. 
TONY: It's not that... 
THOR: (hushes everyone up) It's... stop it! Just let me. (he tears up) Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something great. 
TONY: Look...It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you you're in no condition. 
THOR: What do you think is coursing through my veins right now? 
RHODEY: Cheez Whiz? 
THOR: Lightning. 
TONY: Yeah. 
BRUCE:  Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me. 
[Thor lets go of Tony] 
BRUCE:  You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive. 
STEVE:  How do we know you will? 
BRUCE: We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma. [He takes a good look at the gauntlet] It's like...uh...I was made for this. 
[Nebula (2014) sneaks off to the Quantum portal and activates it] 
TONY: Good to go, yeah? 
BRUCE: Let's do it. 
TONY: You remember... everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years. 
BRUCE: Got it. 
[everyone gets ready and suits up] 
TONY: F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Protocol 8. 
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yes, boss. 
[AVenGERS facility goes on lockdown} 
BRUCE: Everybody comes home. 
[Bruce puts on the gauntlet and the power surge overwhelms him. He grunts in pain.] 
THOR: Take it off. Take it off! 
STEVE; No, wait. Bruce, are you okay? 
TONY: Talk to me, Banner. 
BRUCE: I'm okay. I'm okay. 
[Thor gives a double thumbs up, scene cuts to Nebula (2014) opening the Quantum Tunnel and brings the Sanctuary II to the present] 
[Bruce screams, fighting through the intense pain coursing through his body courtesy of the gauntlet, and manages to snap his fingers. He faints and the gauntlet slides off his arm, Clint kicks it away] 
STEVE: Bruce! 
TONY: Don't move him. 
BRUCE: [Bruce holds onto Steve's arm] Did it work? 
THOR: Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay. 
[Scott walks towards the outside windows and sees plants and birds. Clint hears his phone ringing and sees it's his wife calling] 
CLINT: (struggling to speak from sheer happiness) Honey. Honey. 
SCOTT: Guys...I think it worked! 
[Bruce opens his eyes and sees the Sanctuary II up in the sky and a single missile heading towards the base blowing away Scott away. Then a continuous array of missiles destroys the base completely and everyone sinks below to the underground.] 
[The camera pans over to see Bruce holding up tons of debris from collapsing on top of the other AVenGERS. Some debris is stuck on top of Rocket] 
ROCKET: I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I can't breathe. 
RHODEY: Canopy. Canopy. Canopy. [Rhodey gets out of his damage suit] 
BRUCE: Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here! 
[Rhodey crawls over to help Rocket while taking a rebar as leverage to lift the debris off Rocket] 
ROCKET:  Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! 
[Rhodey gets Rocket out and they both sigh in relief] 
Bruce: Rhodey! 
[A flood engulfs both Rhodey and Rocket] 
[Scene cuts to Scott who survives the blast by shrinking] 
RHODEY: Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're in the lower level, it's flooding! 
SCOTT: What? 
RHODEY: We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday! 
SCOTT: Wait! I'm here! I'm here, can you hear me? 
[Scene cuts to Clint in the sewer system and trying to get his bearings. He flashes a light upwards to see what happened.] 
CLINT: Cap? 
[Clint finds the gauntlet is with him but senses he's not alone down there. He shoots an arrow with light towards the dark tunnel and finds hordes of Outriders] 
CLINT: [under his breath] Damn. 
[Clint takes the gauntlet and runs towards the opposite direction while the Outriders chase after him] 
[Scene cuts to the Sanctuary II and it beams Thanos (2014) to the ground. Nebula walks towards him] 
THANOS (2014):  Daughter. 
NEBULA (2014):  Yes, Father. 
THANOS (2014):  So, this is the future. Well done. 
[Nebula takes off the orange plate on her head and throws it away] 
NEBULA (2014): Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing. 
[Thanos (2014) plants his double-bladed sword on the ground, takes off his helmet and places on top of the sword's edge] 
THANOS (2014):  The arrogant never do. 
[Thanos then sits down] 
THANOS (2014):  Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me. 
NEBULA (2014):  What will you do? 
THANOS (2014):  Wait. 
[Nebula (2014) proceeds to go find the stones and the camera pans over the Sanctuary II and we see Gamora (2014) watching. Gamora (2014) heads over to where Nebula is being held prisoner.] 
GAMORA (2014):  Tell me something.  In the future, what happens to you and me? 
NEBULA:I tried to kill you. Several times. 
[Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes] 
NEBULA:  But eventually, we become friends. We become sisters. 
[Gamora (2014) holds out her hand] 
GAMORA (2014):  Come on. We can stop him. 
[Nebula takes it] 
[Scene cuts to Tony walking towards Steve who's unconscious on the ground] 
TONY:  Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man. You lose this again, I'm keeping it. 
STEVE: What happened? 
TONY: We messed with time. It tends to mess back. You'll see. 
[after the Decimation is undone, Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor discover Thanos from the year 2014, who is fully aware of his plan's success and his fate and the AVenGERS' attempts to undo his plan, has arrived at Earth] 
TONY: What's he been doing? 
THOR: Absolutely nothing. 
STEVE: Where are the stones? 
TONY: Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them. 
STEVE: So we keep it that way. 
THOR: You know it's a trap, right? 
TONY: Yeah. And I don't much care. 
THOR: Good. Just as long we are all in agreement. [summons both Stormbreaker and 2013 Mjolnir] Let's kill him properly this time. 
[The three walk over to confront Thanos face to face] 
THANOS (2014): You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist. 
TONY: Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn. 
THANOS (2014): I'm thankful. Because now, I know what I must do. [stands up] I will shred this universe down to its last atom. [Thanos (2014) puts on his helmet] And then...With the stones you've collected for me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost but only what it has been given. A grateful universe. 
STEVE: Born out of blood. 
THANOS (2014): They'll never know it. Because you won't be alive to tell them. 
[the fighting starts, Thor and Iron man go straight at 2014 Thanos, In the meanwhile Hulk is under all of the mess trying to hold up the structure. Rhodey and Rocket are Breathing for there lives] 
Rhodey: See you on the other side, man. 
Ant-Man: Hang on! I'm coming! 
[Hawkeye is running with the infinity gauntlet. He blows the place. He escapes before the enemies come. he sees 2014 Nebula not knowing that she is evil] 
Clint: Oh, hey... 
Clint: I know you. 
(2014) Nebula: Father. I have the stones. 
Clint: What?! 
2014 Gamora: Stop. 
(2014) Nebula: You're betraying us? 
NEBULA: You don't have to do this. 
(2014) Nebula: I am... this. 
2014 Gamora: No, you're not. 
NEBULA: You've seen what we become. 
2014 Gamora: Nebula, listen to her. 
NEBULA: You can change. 
(2014) Nebula: He won't let me. 
[2014 Nebula points a gun at 2014 Gamora] 
2014 Gamora: No! 
Tony: Okay, Thor. Hit me. 
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, wake up. 
THOR: I knew it! 
THANOS (2014): In all my years of conquest...violence...slaughter... It was never personal. But I'll tell you now... what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet... I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much. 
SAM: Cap, you hear me? 
[Steve stops and looks around] 
SAM: Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me? 
[A yellow portal begins to form behind him] 
SAM: On your left. 
DOCTOR STRANGE: Is that everyone? 
WONG: What, you wanted more? 
[Giant-Man emerges from the rubble of the AVenGERS facility with Professor Hulk, War Machine, and Rocket. The AVenGERS, Guardians, Wakandans, Asgardians, and Ravagers take up battle positions. The heroes standing across Thanos' forces.] 
STEVE: AVenGERS! [he summons Mjolnir]......assemble. 
THOR: No, give me that. You have the little one. 
PETER PARKER: Hey! Holy cow. You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, 'cause I woke up, and you were gone.But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, "It's been five years. Come on, they need us!" And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time... 
PETER PARKER: What are you doing? ...This is nice. 
PETER QUILL: Gamora? I thought I lost you. 
GAMORA (2014): Don't... touch... me! 
PETER QUILL: You missed the first time... Then you got them both the second time. 
GAMORA (2014): This is the one? Seriously? 
NEBULA: The choices were him, or a tree. 

HAWKEYE: Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing? 
STEVE: Get those stones as far away as possible! 
HULK: No! We need to get them back where they came from. 
TONY: No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel. 
SCOTT: Hold on! That wasn't our only time machine. 
STEVE: Anyone see an ugly brown van up there? 
VALKYRIE: Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked. 
TONY: Scott, how long you need to get that thing working? 
SCOTT: Maybe ten minutes. 
STEVE ROGERS: Get it started. We'll get the stones to you. 
HOPE: We're on it, Cap. 

TONY: Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it. 
STRANGE: If I tell you what happens, it won't happen. 
TONY: You better be right. 

HOPE: It's a mess back here. 
SCOTT: It's... it's dead. 
HOPE: What? 
SCOTT: It's dead. I have to hotwire it. 

THANOS (2014): Where's Nebula? 
GLAIVE: She's not responding. 

MAW: Sire! 
TCHALLA: Clint! Give it to me. 
WANDA MAXIMOFF: You took everything from me. 
THANOS (2014): I don't even know who you are. 
WANDA MAXIMOFF: You will. 
PETER PARKER: I got it! Activate Instant Kill! 
THANOS (2014): Rain fire! 
CORVUS GLAIVE: But Sire, our troops! 
THANOS (2014): Just do it! 
PEPPER: Is anyone else seeing this? 
PETER PARKER: I got this. I got this! Okay, I don't got this. Help! Somebody, help! 
STEVE: Hey, Queens. Heads up. 
PEPPER POTTS: Hang on. I got you, kid. 
PETER PARKER: Hey! Nice to meet---  Oh! My God! 
SAM: What the hell is this? 
TONY: F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at? 
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Something just entered the upper atmosphere. 
ROCKET: Oh, yeah! 
STEVE: Danvers, we need an assist here. 
PETER PARKER: Hi. I'm Peter Parker. 
CAPTAIN MARVEL: Hey, Peter Parker. Got something for me? 
PETER PARKER: I don't know how you're gonna get through all that. 
WANDA MAXIMOFF: Don't worry.
OKOYE: She's got help. 
THANOS (2014): I am... inevitable. 
[Thanos snaps his fingers, but nothing happens except a metallic "clink." He sees the Infinity Stones are missing. Tony has the stones on his own gauntlet, to Thanos' shock] 
TONY: And I...am...... Iron Man. 
PETER PARKER: Mr. Stark? [He runs up to his fallen mentor. Tears start to form in his eyes] Hey... Mr. Stark? Can you hear me? It's Peter. We won. Mr. Stark.... We won, Mr. Stark. We won and you did it, sir. You did it. 
[Tony is unresponsive. Peter breaks down and hugs him] 
PETER PARKER: I'm sorry... Tony... 
[Peter is gently led aside to grieve. Pepper Potts sits in front of the fading Iron Man]. 
PEPPER POTTS: Hey. 
[Tony is barely able to move his head, but manages to look Pepper in the eyes] 
TONY: [quietly] Hey, Pep... 
[Pepper takes a good look at Tony's fatal injuries] 
PEPPER POTTS: Friday? 
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Life functions critical. 
PEPPER POTTS: Tony. Look at me. [She makes sure Tony gets a long look at her smiling face] We're gonna be okay. You can rest now. 

TONY STARK (voiceover): Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. I'm hoping if you play this back, it's in celebration. I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back, and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe, now. If you told me ten years ago that we weren't alone, let alone, you know, to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know? That epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And, for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in. 
[Cut to the Stark household. Pepper, Morgan, Happy Hogan and Rhodey all watch Tony's holographic message being projected from his Iron Man helmet. Tony is sitting down recording the message,] 
TONY STARK (hologram): So I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting... In the case of an untimely death on my part. Not that, death in any time isn't untimely. This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow, it's... it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. But then again, that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. [Tony suddenly gets up walking towards his camera] Uh, what am I even trippin' for? Everything's gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to. [He leans down and smiles. He is looking straight at Morgan] I love you 3,000. 
[The message ends and the hologram cuts out.] 
[Cut to Clint and Wanda, standing by the riverside shortly afterwards] 
CLINT: You know, I wish there was a way...that I could let her know. That we won. [Looks over to Wanda] We did it. 
WANDA MAXIMOFF: She knows...They both do. 
[Clint gives her a side hug and Wanda reciprocates] 
[scene cuts to Happy and Morgan] 
HAPPY:  How you doing, Squirt? 
MORGAN: Good. 
HAPPY: You good? Okay. You hungry? 
MORGAN: Mm-hmm. 
HAPPY: What do you want? 
MORGAN: Cheeseburgers. 
HAPPY: You know your dad liked cheeseburgers? I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want. 
MORGAN: Okay. 
[Following the funeral for Tony, we cut to Thor and Valkyrie in New Asgard.] 
VALKYRIE: So, when can we expect you back? 
THOR: Uhhmm...about that... 
VALKYRIE: Thor. Your people need a king. 
THOR: No, they already have one. 
VALKYRIE: That's funny. You're being serious? 
[Thor nods his head] 
THOR: It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are. 
VALKYRIE: You know I'd make a lot of changes around here. 
THOR: I'm counting on it. Your Majesty. 
[Thor offers Valkyrie a farewell handshake] 
VALKYRIE: What will you do? 
THOR: I'm not sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I... I have no path. I do have a ride, though. 
[Camera pans to the Benatar parked on the cliff] 
ROCKET:  Move it or lose it, hairbag. 
[scene cuts to Quill searching for Gamora on the screen as Thor walks in he closes it] 
THOR:  Well, here we are. Tree! Good to see you. Well... [Thor removes his shades and taps Quill on the shoulder] The Asgardians of the Galaxy, back together again. 
[Thor touches the screens map to pick their destination] 
THOR: Where to first? 
QUILL: Just so you know, this is my ship still. I'm in charge. 
THOR: I know. I know. Of course, you are. Of course. 
QUILL: See, you say of course, but then you touch the map. It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge. 
THOR: Quail...you..that-that's  
QUILL: Quail? 
THOR: ...that's your own insecurities in there. Okay? I'm merely trying to be of service. An assistant. 
QUILL: Quill. 
THOR: That's what I said. 
DRAX:  You should fight one another for the honor of leadership. 
NEBULA:  Sounds fair. 
[Quill looks around] 
QUILL: It's not necessary. 
THOR: It's not. 
QUILL: Okay? 
ROCKET:  I got some blasters unless you guys wanna use knives. 
MANTIS: [enthusiastically] Oh, yes. Please, use knives. 
DRAX: Yeah, knives. 
GROOT: I am Groot. 
[Both Thor and Quill laugh but Quill tries to laugh harder] 
QUILL:  Not necessary. 
THOR: Not nece-there shall be no knifing one another. Everybody knows [Thor chuckles] who's in charge. 
QUILL: [glances at Thor] Me, right? 
THOR: Yes, you! Of course! Of course. Of course. 
[scene cuts to Bruce, Steve, Sam and Bucky at the woods] 
BRUCE: Remember... You have to return the stones at the exact moment you got them. Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities. 
STEVE: Don't worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches. 
BRUCE: You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back. [Looks at Steve] I miss them, man. 
STEVE: Me, too. 
SAM: You know, if you want, I can come with you. 
STEVE: You're a good man, Sam. This one's on me, though. 
[Steve goes over to Bucky] 
STEVE: Don't do anything stupid 'till I get back. 
BUCKY: How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you. 
[They both hug each other] 
BUCKY: Gonna miss you, Buddy. 
STEVE: It's gonna be okay, Buck. 
[Steve goes over to the Quantum portal and dons the Quantum suit] 
SAM: How long is this gonna take? 
BRUCE: For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds. 
[Steve picks up Mjolnir (2013)] 
BRUCE:  Ready, Cap?  Alright. We'll meet you back here, okay? 
STEVE: You bet. 
BRUCE: Going quantum. Three, two, one... 
[Steve disappears into the Quantum portal] 
BRUCE: And returning in, five, four, three, two, one... 
[Steve doesn't appear on the pad. Bruce looks around the equipment] 
SAM: Where is he? 
BRUCE: I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp. He should be here. 
[Bucky turns around from the pad] 
SAM: Well, get him back. 
BRUCE: I'm trying. 
SAM: Get him the hell back. 
BRUCE: Hey, I said, I'm trying! 
BUCKY: Sam. 
[Sam walks toward Bucky. Sam, Bruce and Banner sees an old man sitting on a log. Sam and Bucky goes near him] 
BUCKY: Go ahead. 
[Bucky has a smile forming and look over to Sam. He walks towards the old man and instantly recognizes the now-elderly Steve Rogers] 
SAM: Cap? 
(OLD) STEVE: Hi, Sam. 
[Old Steve looks over to Sam] 
SAM: So did something go wrong, or did something go right? 
(OLD) STEVE: Well, after I put the stones back, I thought... Maybe... I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get. 
SAM: How did that work out for you? 
(OLD) STEVE: It was beautiful. 
SAM: I'm happy for you. Truly. 
(OLD) STEVE: Thank you. 
SAM: Only thing bumming me out is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America. 
(OLD) STEVE: Oh... That reminds me... [brings out his SHIeld.] Try it on. 
[Sam look over to Bucky, who nods, and Sam holds Steve's SHIeld.]  
(OLD) STEVE: How's it feel? 
SAM: Like it's someone else's. 
(OLD) STEVE: It isn't. 
[Sam trying to hold back tears] 
SAM: Thank you. I'll do my best. 
(OLD) STEVE: That's why it's yours. [shakes Sam's hand] 
SAM: [seeing elderly Steve's wedding ring] You wanna tell me about her? 
(OLD) STEVE: [smiling]  No. No, I don't think I will.
