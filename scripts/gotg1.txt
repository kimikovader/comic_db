GRANPA
Peter
Your momma wants to speak with you.
Come on, Pete. Take these fool things off.
MEREDITH
Why have you been fighting with the other boys again, baby?
Peter?
PETER QUILL
They killed a little frog that ain‟t done nothing.
Smushed it with a stick.
MEREDITH
You‟re so like your daddy. You even look like him. And he was an angel. Composed out of pure
light.
GRANPA
Mer? You got a present there for Peter, don‟t you?
MEREDITH
Of course. There.
GRANPA
I‟ve got you covered, Pete.
MEREDITH
You open it up when I‟m gone, okay? Your grandpa is gonna take such good care of you. At least
until your daddy comes back to get you. Take my hand. Peter.
GRANPA
Pete, come on.
MEREDITH
Take my hand.
PETER QUILL
Mom? No! No! No! No! Mom! No.
GRANPA
Come with me.
PETER QUILL
No! No!
GRANPA
You‟ve got to stay here. Please.
PETER QUILL
No...
GRANPA
Okay?
PETER QUILL
No. Mom.

KORATH
Drop it.
PETER QUILL
Hey...
KORATH
Drop it now!
PETER QUILL
Hey, cool man. No problem. No problem at all.
KORATH
How do you know about this?
PETER QUILL
I don‟t even know what that is. I‟m just a junker man. I was just checking stuff out.
KORATH
You don‟t look like a junker. You‟re wearing Ravager garb.
PETER QUILL
This is just an outfit, man. Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.
KORATH
What is your name?
PETER QUILL
My name is Peter Quill, okay? Dude chill out.
KORATH
Move!
PETER QUILL
Why?
KORATH
Ronan may have questions for you.
PETER QUILL
Hey you know what? There‟s another name you might know me by. Star-Lord.
KORATH
Who?
PETER QUILL
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw. Guys?
KORATH
Move!
PETER QUILL
Forget this.
BEREET
Peter? What happened?
PETER QUILL
Hey... I...
BEREET
Bereet.
PETER QUILL
Bereet! Look, I‟m gonna be totally honest with you. I forget you‟re here.
BEREET
Peter, you have call.
PETER QUILL
No, wait, don‟t!
YONDU UDONTA
Quill?
PETER QUILL
Hey, Yondu.
YONDU UDONTA
I‟m here on Morag. Ain‟t no Orb, ain‟t no you.
PETER QUILL
Well, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I‟d save you the hassle.
YONDU UDONTA
Well, where are you at now, boy?
PETER QUILL
I feel really bad about this, but I‟m not gonna tell you that.
YONDU UDONTA
I slaved putting this deal together.
PETER QUILL
Slave? Making a few calls is “slaved”? I mean, really? And how you‟re gonna rip me off!
YONDU UDONTA
We do not do that to each other. We‟re Ravagers. We got a code.
PETER QUILL
Yeah, and that code is “steal from everybody”
YONDU UDONTA
When I picked you up on Terra...
PETER QUILL
“Picked me up”
YONDU UDONTA
...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
PETER QUILL
Yeah?
YONDU UDONTA
They ain‟t never tasted any Terran before. I stopped them. You‟re alive because of me! I will find
you, I will...
YONDU UDONTA
Put a bounty on him! Forty K. But I want him back alive.
FORTY K
Yeah, Cap.
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Alive?
That‟s what I said.
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
I told you when you picked that kid up, you should have delivered him like we was hired to do! He
was cargo! You have always been soft on him.
YONDU UDONTA
You‟re the only one I‟m being soft on! Now, don‟t you worry about Mr. Quill. As soon as we get him
back here, I‟m gonna kill him myself. What we do need to worry about, is who else out there wants
that Orb!
RONAN
They call me “terrorist”, “radical”, “zealot”, because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree,
and punish those who do not. Because I do not forgive your people for talking the life of my father,
and his father, and his father before him. A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten!
XANDARIANs
You can‟t do this! Our government signed a peace treaty.
RONAN
My government knows no shame. You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.
XANDARIANs
You will never rule Xandar.
RONAN
No. I will cure it!
NEBULA
Ronan, Korath has returned.
KORATH
Master, he is a thief, an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord. But we have discovered he has an
agreement to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary known as The Broker.
RONAN
I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him. Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.
Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the Orb.
NEBULA
It will be my honor.
GAMORA
It will be your doom. If this happens again, you‟ll be facing our father without his prize.
NEBULA
I‟m a daughter of Thanos. Just like you.
GAMORA
But I know Xandar.
NEBULA
Ronan has already decreed that I...
RONAN
Do not speak for me. You will not fail.
GAMORA
Have I ever?
ROCKET
Xandarians. What a bunch of losers. All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid, to
nothing at all. Pathetic. Look at this guy! Can you believe they call us criminals, when he‟s assaulting
us with that haircut?
What is this thing? Look how it thinks it‟s cool. It‟s not cool to get help! Walk by yourself, you little
gargoyle.
Look at Mr. Smiles over here. Where‟s your wife, old man? What a class-A pervert. Hahaha... Right,
Groot? Groot?
ROCKET
Don‟t drink fountain water, you idiot. That‟s disgusting!
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it! Why are you lying?
Looks like we got one. Okay, homie, how bad does someone wanna find you?
40,000 units? Groot we‟re gonna be rich.

THE BROKER
Mr. Quill.
PETER QUILL
Broker. The Orb. As commissioned.
THE BROKER
Where‟s Yondu?
PETER QUILL
Wanted to be here. Sends his love. And fold me to tell you, that you got the best eyebrows in this
business. What is it?
THE BROKER
It‟s my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs.
PETER QUILL
Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.
THE BROKER
An occupational hazard, I‟m sure, in your line of work.
PETER QUILL
Some machine-headed freak, working for a dude named Ronan.
THE BROKER
Ronan? I‟m sorry, Mr. Quill. I truly am. But I want no part of this transaction if Ronan is involved.
PETER QUILL
Who‟s Ronan?
THE BROKER
A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty, who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture, is
wiped from existence!
PETER QUILL
Come on.
THE BROKER
He‟s someone whose bad side I‟d rather not be on.
PETER QUILL
What? What about my bad side?
THE BROKER
Farewell, Mr. Quill.
PETER QUILL
Hey, we had a deal, bro!
GAMORA
What happened?
PETER QUILL
This guy just backed out of a deal on me. If there‟s one this I hate. It‟s a man without integrity. Peter
Quill. People call me Star-Lord.
GAMORA
You have the bearing of a man of honor.
PETER QUILL
Well, you know, I wouldn‟t say that. People say it about me, all the time, but it‟s not something I
would ever say about myself.
GAMORA
This wasn‟t the plan. 
ROCKET
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag! No! Not her, him! Learn genders, man. Bitting? That‟s not
fair! 
ROCKET
Take it easy!
GAMORA
Fool. You should have learned.
PETER QUILL
I don‟t learn. One of my issues.
PETER QUILL
What the...
ROCKET
Quit smiling, you idiot. You‟re supposed to be a professional. You gotta be kidding me.
ROCKET
Hey! 
ROCKET
I live for the simple things. Like how much this gonna hurt. Yeah. Writhe, little man. It‟ll grow back,
Quit whining.
CORPSMAN DEY
Subject 89 P13, drop your weapon.
ROCKET
Crap.
CORPSMAN DEY
By the authority of the Nova Corps, you all under arrest...
PETER QUILL
All right. Come on up.
For endangerment to life and the destruction of property.
CORPSMAN DEY
Hey! If it isn‟t Star-Prince.
PETER QUILL
Star-Lord.
CORPSMAN DEY
Sorry. “Lord”.
I picked this guy up awhile back for petty thief. He‟s got a code name
Yeah. Stay out of the way.
PETER QUILL
Come on, man. It‟s a... It‟s an outlaw name.
Just relax, pal. It‟s cool to have a code name. It‟s not that weird.
ROCKET
Fascists.

NOVA PRIME
Ronan is destroying Xandarian out posts throughout the galaxy. I should think that would call for
some slight response on the part of the Kree.
KREE
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime. What more do you want?
NOVA PRIME
At least a statement from the Kree Empire saying that they condemn his actions. He is slaughtering
children. Families.
That is you business. Now, I have other matters to attend.
NOVA PRIME
Prick.
DENARIAN SAAL
Well, some good news. It look like we‟ve apprehended one of Ronan‟s compatriots.
Gamora. Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon. The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan,
Thanos. Recently, Thanos lend her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan, which leads us to believe that
Thanos and Ronan working together.
Subject 89P13. Call itself “Rocket”. The result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a
lower life form.
They call it “Groot”. A humanoid plant that‟s been traveling recently as 89P13‟s personal
houseplantlmuscle.
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra. Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers, led
by Yondu Udonta.
PETER QUILL
I‟m sorry. I didn‟t know how this machine worked.
CORPSMAN DEY 
What a bunch of a-holes. Transport all four to the Kyln.


ROCKET
I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws, but these ones here, they‟re corrupt and cruel.
But, hey, that‟s not my problem. I ain‟t gonna be here long. I‟ve escape 22 prisons. This one‟s no
different. You‟re lucky the broad showed up, because otherwise, me and Groot would be collecting
that bounty right now, and you‟d be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.
PETER QUILL
I‟ve had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years. I ain‟t about to be brought down by a tree and a
talking raccoon.
ROCKET
Hold. What‟s a raccoon.
PETER QUILL
“What‟s a raccoon?” It‟s what you are, stupid.
ROCKET
Ain‟t no thing like me, except me.
PETER QUILL
So, this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase, Ark of the covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe. What is
it?
GROOT
I am Groot.
PETER QUILL
So what? What‟s the Orb?
GAMORA
I have no words for an honorless thief.
ROCKET
Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac. Yeah, I know who you are.
Anyone who‟s anyone knows who you are.
PETER QUILL
Yeah, we know who you are. Who is she?
GROOT
I am Groot.
PETER QUILL
Yeah, you said that.
GAMORA
I wasn‟t retrieving the Orb for Ronan. I was betraying him. I had an agreement to sell it to a third
party.
GROOT
I am Groot.
PETER QUILL
Well, that‟s just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told me that. What is wrong with Giving Tree,
here?
ROCKET
Well, he don‟t know talking good like me and you. So his vocabulistics is limited to “I” and “am” and
“Groot”. Exclusively in that order.
PETER QUILL
I tell you what, that‟s gonna wear real thin, a real fast.
Hey. Put that away. Hey! Listen to me, you big blue bastard. Take those headphones off. That‟s mine.
That tape and that player is mine!
That song belongs to me!

ROCKET
It‟s like I said, she‟s got a rep. a lot of prisoners here have lost their families to Ronan and his goons.
She‟ll last a day, tops.
THE PRISONERS
- Murderer!
PETER QUILL
The guards will protect her, right?
ROCKET
They‟re here to stop us from getting out. They don‟t care what we do to each other inside.
GAMORA
Whatever nightmares the future holds, are dreams compared to what‟s behind me.
THE PRISONERS
Check out the new meat. I‟m gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly, and go to town... Groot poked
The Prisoner‟s nose and lifted him
ROCKET
Let‟s make something clear. This one here is our booty! You wanna get to him, you go through us!
Or, more accurately, we go through you.
PETER QUILL
I‟m with them.
THE PRISONERS
I hate you.
THE PRISON‟S GUARD
Take her down to the showers. It‟ll be easier to clean up the blood down there.
ROCKET
Quill, where you going? Quill. Quill!
THE PRISONER
Gamora, consider this a death sentence for your crimes against the galaxy.
DRAX
You dare? You know who I am, yes?
THE PRISONER
You‟re Drax. The destroyer.
ROCKET
Quill.
DRAX
And you know why they call me this.
THE PRISONER
You slayed dozens of Ronan‟s minions.
DRAX
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette, and my daughter, Camaria. He slaughtered them where they stood.
And he laughed!
ROCKET
Quill.
DRAX
Her life is not yours to take. He killed my family. I shall kill one of his in return.
THE PRISONER
Of course, Drax. Here, I...
ROCKET
Quill! What are you doing?
GAMORA
I‟m no family to Ronan or Thanos. I‟m your only hope at stopping him.
DRAX
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!
PETER QUILL
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
ROCKET
Crap.
PETER QUILL
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose, I don‟t think this is the best way to go about it.
DRAX
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?
PETER QUILL
Well, I mean, she‟s hardly the first woman to try and do that to me. Look, this is from a smoking-hot
Rajak girl. Stabbed me with a fork. Didn‟t like me skipping out on her at sunrise. I got, right here, a
Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax. She caught me with this skinny little A‟askavariian who worked
in Nova Records. I was trying to get information. You never see an A‟askavariian?. They have
tentacles, and needles for teeth. If you think I‟m seriously interested in that, then... you don‟t care. But
there‟s the point. She betrayed Ronan. He‟s coming back for her. And when he does that‟s when
you...
DRAX
Why would I put my finger on his throat?
PETER QUILL
What? No, it‟s a symbol. This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.
DRAX
I would not slice his throat. I would cut his head clean off.
PETER QUILL
It‟s a general expression for you killing somebody. You‟ve heard this. You‟ve seen this, right? you know what that is.
THE PRISONER
Yeah.. Yeah.
PETER QUILL
Everyone knows.
THE PRISONER
No. No. when Drax look at him
PETER QUILL
What I‟m saying is, you want to keep her alive. Don‟t do his work for him.
DRAX
I like your knife. I‟m keeping it.
THE PRISONER
That was my favorite knife.
PETER QUILL
Listen! I could care less whether you live or whether you die.
GAMORA
Then why stop the big guy?
PETER QUILL
Simple you know where to sell my Orb.
GAMORA
How are gonna sell it when we and it are still here?
PETER QUILL
My friend Rocket, here, has escaped 22 prisons.
ROCKET
We‟re getting out. And then we‟re headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.
PETER QUILL
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?
GAMORA
Four billion units.
ROCKET
What?
PETER QUILL
Holy shit.
GAMORA
That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan. If you free us, I‟ll lead you to the
buyer directly and I‟ll split the profit between the three of us.
GROOT
I am Groot.
ROCKET
Four of us. A sleep for the danger, awake for the money, as per frickin‟ usual.

THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
You have been betrayed, Ronan.
RONAN
We know only that she has been captured. Gamora may yet recover the Orb.
THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
No! Our sources within the Kyln say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb. Look, your partnership
with Thanos is at risk. Thanos requires your presence. Now!

RONAN
With all due respect, Thanos, your daughter made this mess, and yet you summon me.
THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
I would lower my voice, Accuser.
RONAN
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.
THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.
RONAN
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.
THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.
RONAN
Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time!
THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
Lower your tone! I may be your... Ronan kill him
RONAN
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.
THANOS
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy, is you. Your politics bore me. Your demeanor is that of a
pouty child. And, apparently, you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora. I shall honor our
agreement, Kree, if you bring mr the Orb. But return to me again empty-handed, and I will bathe the
starways in your blood.
NEBULA
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair. This is one fight you won‟t win. Let‟s head to the Kyln.

ROCKET
If we‟re gonna get out of here, we‟re gonna need to get into that watchtower. And to do that, I‟m
gonna need a few things. The guards wear security bands to control their ins and outs. I need one.
GAMORA
Leave it to me.
ROCKET
That dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg.
PETER QUILL
His leg?
ROCKET
Yeah. God knows I don‟t need the rest of him. Look at him, he‟s useless.
PETER QUILL
All right.
ROCKET
And finally, on the wall back there is a black panel. Blinky yellow light. Do you see it?
PETER QUILL
Yeah.
ROCKET
There‟s a quarnyx battery behind it. Purplish box, green wires. To get into that watchtower, I
definitely need it.
GAMORA
How are we supposed to do that?
ROCKET
Well, supposably these bald-bodies find you attractive. So maybe you can work out some sort of
trade.
GAMORA
You must be joking.
ROCKET
No, I really hear they find you attractive.
PETER QUILL
Look, it‟s 20 feet up in the air, and it‟s in the middle of the most heavily-guarded part of the prison.
It‟s impossible to get up there without being seen.
ROCKET
I got one plan, and that plan requires a frickin‟ quarnyx battery, so figure it out! Can I get back to it?
Thanks. Now, this is important. Once the battery is removed, everything is gonna slam into
emergency mode. Once we have it, we gotta move quickly, so you definitely need to get that last. Or
we could just get it first and improvise.

GAMORA
I‟ll get the armband.
PETER QUILL
Leg.
GUARD
Prisoner, drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell, or we will open fire.
GROOT
I am Groot.
Fire!
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.
ROCKET
You idiot! How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?
GUARD
The animal is in control. Fire on my command!
DRAX
Creepy little beast!
ROCKET
Oh, yeah.

You need what? 

GAMORA
I‟ll need this.

Good luck. It‟s internally wired.
GAMORA
I‟ll figure something out.
GUARD
Drop the leg! Drop the leg and move back to your cell!

GAMORA
Rocket!
ROCKET
Move to the watchtower!
DRAX
You! Man who has lain with an
A‟askavariian!
PETER QUILL
It was one time, man.

GUARD
We need all available guards in full combat gear...
DRAX
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.
GAMORA
Why is this one here?
PETER QUILL
We promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss. I always keep my promises,
when they‟re to muscle-bound whack-jobs who will kill me if I don‟t.
Here you go.
ROCKET
Oh I was just kidding about that leg. I just need these two things.
PETER QUILL
What?
ROCKET
No, I thought it‟d be funny. Was it funny? Wait, what did he look like hopping around?
PETER QUILL
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!
ROCKET
Hahaha laughing
DRAX
How are we going to leave?
PETER QUILL
Well, he‟s got a plan. Right? Or is that another thing you made up?
ROCKET
I have a plan! I have a plan!
DRAX
Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.
PETER QUILL
Yeah, I‟ll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one.
DRAX
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.
PETER QUILL
It‟s just a metaphor, dude.
ROCKET
His people are completely literal. Metaphors are gonna go over his head.
DRAX
Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.
GAMORA
I‟m gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.
Those are some big guns.
THE PRISON‟S GUARD
Preparing the shoot target to the watchtower On my command! Number one!
GAMORA
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
ROCKET
Hold on! Number two!
DRAX
I recognize this animal. We‟d roast them over a flame pit as children. Their flesh was quite delicious.
ROCKET
Not helping!
THE PRISON‟S GUARD
Number three!
All fire on my command! Three! Two! One!
GAMORA
He turned off the artificial gravity, everywhere but in here.
ROCKET
I told you I had a plan.
PETER QUILL
That was a pretty good plan.

PETER QUILL
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship. It‟s the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.
ROCKET
The crumpled my pants up into a ball. That‟s rude! They folded yours.
GAMORA
The Orb‟s there. Let‟s go.
PETER QUILL
Wait, wait, wait.
GAMORA
What?
PETER QUILL
That bastard didn‟t put it back.
GAMORA
Put what back?
PETER QUILL
Here. Get them to the ship. I will be right back.
GAMORA
How are you gonna possibly...
PETER QUILL
Just keep the Milano close by. Go. Go!

My neck!

ROCKET
Well. How‟s he gonna get to us?
GAMORA
He declined to share that information with me.
ROCKET
Well, screw this, then! I ain‟t waiting around for some homie with a death wish. You got the Orb,
right?
GAMORA

ROCKET
If we don‟t leave now, we will be blown to bits.
GAMORA
No! we‟re not leaving without the Orb.
DRAX
Behold.
This one shows spirit. He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan companion, what were
you retrieving?
You‟re an imbecile.

PETER QUILL
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing? You can‟t take apart my ship without asking me! See, what is
this?
ROCKET
Don‟t touch that! It‟s a bomb.
PETER QUILL
A bomb?
ROCKET
Yup.
PETER QUILL
And you leave it lying around?
ROCKET
I was gonna put it in a box.
PETER QUILL
What‟s a box gonna do?
ROCKET
How about this one?
PETER QUILL
No! Hey! Leave it alone. Shut up.
ROCKET
Hey!
PETER QUILL
What is that?
ROCKET
That‟s for if things get really hardcore. Or if you wanna blow up moons.
GAMORA
No one‟s blowing up moons.
ROCKET
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.
PETER QUILL
So, listen I‟m gonna need your buyer‟s coordinates.
GAMORA
We‟re heading in the right direction. For now.
PETER QUILL
If we‟re gonna work together, you might try trusting me a little bit.
GAMORA
And how much do you trust me?
PETER QUILL
I‟d trust you a lot more if you told me what this was. Because I‟m guessing it‟s some kind of weapon.
GAMORA
I don‟t know what it is.
DRAX
If it‟s a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.
GAMORA
Put it down, you fool. You‟ll destroy us all.
DRAX
Or just you, murderess.
GAMORA
I let you live once, princess!
DRAX
I am not a princess!
PETER QUILL
Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We‟re stuck together until we get the money.
DRAX
I have no interest in money.
PETER QUILL
Great.
That means more money for the three of us.
GROOT
I am Groot.
PETER QUILL
For the four of us. Partners.
GAMORA
We have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you. I‟ll tell the buyer we‟re on
our way. And Quill, your ship is filthy.
PETER QUILL
She has no idea. If I had a black light, the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.
ROCKET
You got issues, Quill.

MAN
I swear. I don‟t know where they went! I swear.
NEBULA
If he knew where they were headed, he would have already told us.
Yeah.
NEBULA
Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison.
RONAN
Well, then, send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant. Find the Orb. Any means, any price.
NEBULA
And this place?
RONAN
The Nova can‟t know what we‟re after. Cleanse it!

YONDU UDONTA
Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one? I like to stick „em all in a row on my control
console.
THE BROKER
I can‟t tell if you‟re joking or not.
YONDU‟S SURBORDINATE
He‟s being fully serious.
THE BROKER
In that case, I can show you...
YONDU UDONTA
But first, you gonna tell me what this Orb is, and why everybody cares so damn much about it. And
then you gonna tell me, who out there might wanna buy it.
THE BROKER
Sir, the high-end community is a... The high-end community is a... It‟s a tight-knit... Tight-knit... The
high-end community is a very tight-knit... I cannot possibly betray the confidentiality of my buyers!
YONDU UDONTA
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

THE COLLECTOR
Carina
CARINA
Yes, master.
THE COLLECTOR
Your people do have elbows, do they not?
CARINA
We do, master.
THE COLLECTOR
Then use them. I don‟t have to remain you what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me.
Do I? Chop, chop. Our guests will be here soon.

ROCKET
Heads up! We‟re inbound.
DRAX
What is it?
GAMORA
It‟s called Knowhere. The severed head of an ancient celestial being. Be wary headed in, rodent.
There are no regulations whatsoever here.
KNOWHERE
MINING COLONY
GAMORA
Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in to mine the organic matter within the skull.
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid. All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy.
It‟s dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws.
PETER QUILL
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.
DRAX
It sounds like a place, which I would like to visit.
PETER QUILL
Yeah, you should.
CHILDRENS IN KNOWHERE
Excuse  me
PETER QUILL
Watch your wallets.
CHILDRENS IN KNOWHERE
Can you spare any units?
PETER QUILL
Get out of here.
PETER QUILL
Your buyer‟s in there?
GAMORA
We are to wait here for his representative.
BIG GUARD IN THE KNOWHERE
Get out of here!
DRAX
This is no respectable establishment. What do you expect us to do while we wait?

DRAX
Yes! Yes!
ROCKET
Yahoo!
DRAX
My Orloni has won, as I won at all things! Now, let‟s put more of this liquid into our bodies.
ROCKET
That‟s the first thing you said that wasn‟t bat-shit crazy!

Man, you wouldn‟t believe what they charge for fuel out here. I might actually lose money on this
job.
GAMORA
My connection is making us wait.
PETER QUILL
It‟s just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty. Where yours is more, “stab, stab. Those
are my terms.”
GAMORA
My father didn‟t stress diplomacy.
PETER QUILL
Thanos?
GAMORA
He‟s not my father. When Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me. He
tortured me, turned me into a weapon. When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for
Ronan, I couldn‟t stand by and... Why would you risk your life for this?
PETER QUILL
My mother gave it to me. My mom liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up.
I happened to have it on me, when I was... The day that she... You know, when I left Earth.
GAMORA
What do you do with it?
PETER QUILL
Do? Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance.
GAMORA
I‟m a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.
PETER QUILL
Really? On my planet, there‟s a legend about people like you. It‟s called footloose. And in it, a great
hero named Kevin Bacon, teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing,
well... it‟s the greatest thing there is.
GAMORA
Who put the sticks up their butts?
PETER QUILL
What? No, that‟s just a...
GAMORA
That is cruel.
PETER QUILL
It‟s just a phrase people use.
GAMORA
The melody is pleasant! No! Peter want to kiss Gamora and Gamora become angry then put a knife
in Peter‟s neck
PETER QUILL
What the hell?
GAMORA
I know who you are, Peter Quill! And I am not same starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your... Your
pelvic sorcery!
PETER QUILL
This is not what is happening here.
No.
GAMORA
Stop it!
PETER QUILL
What are you doing?
DRAX
This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!
ROCKET
That is true!
He has no respect!
DRAX
That is also true!
PETER QUILL
Hold on! Hold on!
ROCKET
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy! You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!
GAMORA
Rocket, you‟re drunk. All right? No one‟s laughing at you.
ROCKET
He thinks I‟m some stupid thing! He does! Well. I didn‟t ask to get made! I didn‟t ask to be torn
apart, and put back together, over and over, and turned into some.. Some little monster!
PETER QUILL
Rocket, no one‟s calling you a monster.
ROCKET
He called me “vermin”! She called me “rodent”! Let‟s see if you can laugh after five or six good shots
to your frickin‟ face!
PETER QUILL
No, no, no, no! Four billion units! Rocket! Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one more lousy night
and you‟re rich.
ROCKET
Fine. But I can‟t promise, when all this is over I‟m not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.
PETER QUILL
See? That‟s exactly why none of you have any friends! Five seconds after you meet somebody, you‟re
already trying to kill them!
DRAX
We have travelled, halfway across the quadrant. And Ronan is no closer to being dead.
PETER QUILL
Drax!
GAMORA
Let him go. We don‟t need him.

CATARINA
Milady Gamora. I‟m here to fetch you for my master.
ROCKET
Okay, this isn‟t creepy at all.
CATARINA
We house the galaxy‟s largest collection of fauna, relics, and species of all manners. I present to you.
The Collector.
THE COLLECTOR
Oh, my dear Gamora. How wonderful to meet in the flesh.
Let‟s bypass the formalities, Tivan. We have what we discussed.
THE COLLECTOR
What is that this there?
GROOT
I am Groot.
ROCKET
I never thought I‟d meet a Groot.
THE COLLECTOR
Sir... 
You must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass. At the moment of your death, of
course.
GROOT
I am Groot.
ROCKET
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin‟ chair?
THE COLLECTOR
That‟s your pet?
ROCKET
His what?
GAMORA
Tivan. We have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.
THE COLLECTOR
Very well, then. Let us see what you brought.

RADIO MAN
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of cotati seeds. No, cases. Last time, you sent me...
DRAX
You shall send a message for me.

THE COLLECTOR
Oh, my new friends. Before creation itself, there were six singularities. Then the universe exploded
into existence, and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots. Infinity
Stones. These stones, it seems, can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength. Observe.
These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field.
PETER QUILL
There‟s a little pee coming out of me right now.
THE COLLECTOR
Once, for a moment... a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves, but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.
The Ord is opened Beautiful. Beyond compare.
ROCKET
Blah blah blah. We‟re all very fascinated, whitey. But we‟d like to get paid.
How would you like to get paid?
ROCKET
What do you think fancy man? Units!
THE COLLECTOR
Very well, then.
Carina approach the kernel of the Orb Carina. Stand back.
CARINA
I will no longer be your slave!
THE COLLECTOR
No!
PETER QUILL
What the f...
GAMORA
How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the Orb?
ROCKET
What do you still have it for?
PETER QUILL
What are we gonna do, leave it in there?
ROCKET
I can‟t believe you had that in your purse!
PETER QUILL
It‟s not a purse, it‟s a knapsack!
GAMORA
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps. There‟s a chance they can contain it.
ROCKET
Are you kidding me? We‟re wanted by the Nova Corps. Just give it to Ronan.
PETER QUILL
So he can destroy the galaxy?
ROCKET
What are you, some saint all of a sudden? What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you
wanna save it?
PETER QUILL
Because I‟m one of the idiots who lives in it!
GAMORA
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan‟s hands. We have to go back to your
ship, and deliver it to Nova.
PETER QUILL
Right, right, okay. I think you‟re right. Or we could give it to somebody who‟s not going to arrest us,
who‟s really nice for a whole lot of money. I think it‟s a really good balance between both of your
points of view.
GAMORA
You‟re despicable. Dishonorable. Faithless!
Oh no.
DRAX
At last! I shall meet my foe and destroy him.
PETER QUILL
You called Ronan?
YONDU UDONTA
Quill! Don‟t you move, boy! Don‟t you move! Get out of my way!
DRAX
Ronan the Accuser!
RONAN
You are the one who transmitted the message?
DRAX
You killed my wife. You killed my daughter!

ROCKET
I told you, you can‟t fit. Now, wait here. I‟ll be back.

NEBULA
It is Gamora. She is escaping with the Orb.
DRAX
No.
RONAN
Nebula, retrieve the Orb.

NEBULA
The stone is in the furthest pod.
Bring it down!

PETER QUILL
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.
ROCKET
How? We‟ve got no weaponry on these things.
PETER QUILL
These pods are industrial grade. They‟re nearly indestructible.
ROCKET
Not against necroblasts, they‟re not.
PETER QUILL
That‟s not what I‟m saying.

PETER QUILL
Let me borrow your ride.

RONAN
I don‟t recall killing your family. I doubt I‟ll remember killing you, either.

GAMORA
Quill, I‟m trapped. I can‟t make it to the Milano. I have to head out.
PETER QUILL
Wait! These things aren‟t meant to go out there.
NEBULA
You are a disappointment, sister. Of all our siblings, I hate you least.
GAMORA
Nebula, please... If Ronan gets this stone he‟ll kill us all.
NEBULA
Not all. You will already be dead.
NEBULA
Ronan, it is done. 

ROCKET
Quill, come on. Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes, but there‟s nothing we
can do for her. These pods aren‟t meant to be out here. In second, we‟re gonna be in the same boat.
PETER QUILL
Damn it. Peter preparing to get out from the pod
Quill?
PETER QUILL
Yondu! Yondu. This is Quill! My coordinates are 227 K324.
ROCKET
Quill! Quill, what are you doing?
PETER QUILL
Just outside Knowhere. If you‟re there, come get me. I‟m all yours.
ROCKET
Quill, don‟t be ridiculous. Get back into your pod! You can‟t fit two people in there. You‟re gonna
die. You‟ll die in seconds! Quill.

GAMORA
Quill? What happened?
PETER QUILL
I saw you out there. I don‟t know what came over me. But I couldn‟t let you die. I found something
inside of myself. Something... incredibly heroic. I mean, not to brag, but, objectively..
GAMORA
Where‟s the Orb?
PETER QUILL
It‟s.. well, they got the Orb.
GAMORA
What?
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Welcome home, Peter.

ROCKET
Blasted idiot. They‟re all idiots! Quill just got himself captured. None of this ever would have
happened if you didn‟t try to single-handedly take on a frickin‟ army!
DRAX
You‟re right. I was a fool. All the anger, all the rage, was just to cover my loss.
ROCKET
Oh boohoo. “My wife and child are dead” I don‟t care if it‟s mean! Everybody‟s got dead people. It‟s
no excuse to get everybody else dead along the way!
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone. The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the
universe as fast as we can and maybe, just maybe, we‟ll be able to live full lives before that whack-
job ever gets there.
GROOT
I am Groot.
ROCKET
Save them? How?
GROOT
I am Groot.
I know there‟re the only friends that we ever had, but there‟s an army of Ravagers around them. And
there‟s only two of us!
DRAX
Three.
ROCKET
You‟re making me beat... up grass! while beat up grass

In the Ronan‟s ship
RONAN
The Orb is in my possession, as I promised.
THANOS
Bring it to me.
RONAN
Yes, that was our agreement. Bring you the Orb, and you will destroy Xandar for me. However, now
that I know it contains an Infinity Stone, I wonder what use I have for you.
THANOS
Boy, I would reconsider your current course.
KORATH
Master! You cannot! Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.
RONAN
Not anymore. You call me “boy”! I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on
Xandar, and burn it to its core! Then, Thanos, I am coming for you.
NEBULA
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?
RONAN
You dare to oppose me?
NEBULA
You see what he was turned me into. If you kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets.

YONDU UDONTA
You betray me? Hit Peter Steal my money?
GAMORA
Stop it! Leave him alone!
YONDU UDONTA
When I picked you up as a kid, these boys wanted to eat you. They ain‟t never tasted Terran before. I
saved your life!
PETER QUILL
Oh will you shut up about that? God! Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face, like it‟s some
great thing, not eating me. Normal people don‟t even thing about eating someone else!
Much less that person having to be grateful for it! You abducted me, man. You stole me from my
home and from my family.
YONDU UDONTA
You don‟t give a damn about your Terra! You‟re scared because you‟re soft in here. Here, right here!
GAMORA
Yondu. Listen to me. Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.
YONDU UDONTA
I know what he‟s got, girl.
GAMORA
Then you know we must get it back! He‟s gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.
We have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.
YONDU UDONTA
Is that what she‟s been filling your head with, boy? Sentiment? Eating away your brain like maggots!
That‟s it.
GAMORA
No!
YONDU UDONTA
Sorry. Boy. But a captain‟s gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him.
Captain‟s gotta teach stuff!
ALL YOUNDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Yes.
PETER QUILL
If you kill me now, you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen.
YONDU UDONTA
The Stone? I hope you got something better than that. Because ain‟t nobody stealing from Ronan.
PETER QUILL
We got a ringer.
YONDU UDONTA
Is that right?
PETER QUILL
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan. His ships, his army.
GAMORA
He‟s vulnerable.
PETER QUILL
Hey, what do you say, Yondu? Me and you, talking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days.
YONDU UDONTA
Hahaha... Let him go! You always did have a scrote, boy! That‟s why I kept you on as a young‟un.
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.
ROCKET
Attention, idiots. The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer. It‟s a weapon of my
own design.
YONDU UDONTA
What the hell?
ROCKET
If you don‟t hand over our companions now, he‟s gonna tear your ship a new one. A very big new
one!
YONDU UDONTA
I ain‟t buyin‟ it.
ROCKET
I‟m giving you to the count of five. 5, 4, 3..
PETER QUILL
No. wait, hold on! Rocket, it‟s me, for God sakes! We figured it out! We‟re fine!
ROCKET
Oh hey, Quill. What‟s going on?

ROCKET
You call that “figured it out”? we‟re gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.
PETER QUILL
You want to talk about senseless? How about trying to save us by blowing us up?
ROCKET
We were only gonna blow you up if they didn‟t turn you over!
PETER QUILL
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five?
ROCKET
We didn‟t have time to work out the minutiae of the plan. This is what we get for acting altruistically.
GROOT
I am Groot.
ROCKET
They are ungrateful.
GAMORA
What‟s important now is we get the Ravangers‟ army to help us save Xandar.
ROCKET
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who‟s just gonna sell to somebody even worse?
PETER QUILL
We‟ll figure that part out later.
GAMORA
We have to stop Ronan.
ROCKET
How?
PETER QUILL
I have a plan.
ROCKET
You‟ve got a plan?
PETER QUILL
Yes.
ROCKET
First of all, you‟re copying me from when I said I had a plan.
PETER QUILL
No, I‟m not. People say that all the time. It‟s not that unique of a thing to say.
ROCKET
Secondly, I don‟t even believe you have a plan.
PETER QUILL
I have part of a plan!
DRAX
What percentage of a plan do you have?
GAMORA
You don‟t get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.
DRAX
I just saved Quill.
PETER QUILL
We‟ve already established that you destroying the ship that I‟m on is not saving me.
DRAX
When did we establish it?
PETER QUILL
Like three seconds ago!
DRAX
I wasn‟t listening. I was thinking of something else.
ROCKET
She‟s right. You don‟t get an opinion. What percentage?
PETER QUILL
I don‟t know. Twelve percent.
ROCKET
Twelve percent? Hahaha
PETER QUILL
That‟s a fake laugh.
ROCKET
It‟s real!
PETER QUILL
Totally fake.
ROCKET
That is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life because that is not a plan.
GAMORA
It‟s barely a concept.
PETER QUILL
You‟re taking their side?
GROOT
I am Groot.
ROCKET
So what, it‟s better than 11%? What the hell does that have to do with anything?
PETER QUILL
Thank you, Groot. Thank you. See? Groot‟s the only one of you has a clue. Guys. Come on. Yondu is
gonna be here in two seconds. He expects to hear this big plan of ours. I need your help. I look around
at us. You know what I see? Losers. I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff. And we have. Man, we
have. All of us. Our home, our families, normal lives. And, usually, life takes more that it gives. But
not today. Today, it‟s given us something. It has given us a chance.
DRAX
To do what?
PETER QUILL
To give a shit. For once. Not to run away. I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan
wipes out billions of innocent lives.
ROCKET
But, Quill, stopping Ronan, it‟s impossible. You‟re asking us to die.
PETER QUILL
Yeah, I guess I am.
GAMORA
Quill. I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies. I will be grateful to die among my
friends.
DRAX
You are an honorable man, Quill. I will fight beside you. And in the end, I will see my wife and
daughter again.
GROOT
I am Groot.
ROCKET
Huh.. what the hell. I don‟t got that long a life span, anyway. Now I‟m standing. Y‟all happy? We‟re
all standing up now. bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.
GAMORA
The stone reacts to anything organic. The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.
PETER QUILL
All Ronan‟s got to do is touch the Stone to the planet‟s surface and zap. All plants, animals, Nova
Corps.
GAMORA
Everything will die.
PETER QUILL
So Ronan does not make the surface.

PETER QUILL
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Aster‟s Starboard hull. Then, our craft and
Yondu‟s will enter.
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Won‟t there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?
DRAX
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

GAMORA
Once they know we‟re on board, Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on
desk. Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.
PETER QUILL
We‟ll make it to the flight desk, and I‟ll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.
GAMORA
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone. Use these devices to contain it. If you touch it, it will
kill you.
PETER QUILL
I‟ll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us. Hopefully, they‟ll believe we‟re there to help.
ROCKET
There‟s one more thing we need to complete the plan. That guy‟s eye.
PETER QUILL
No! No, we don‟t. no, we don‟t need that guy‟s eye.
ROCKET
No, seriously, I need it! It‟s important to me.

Ronan fleet has been spotted, and will arrive in T-minus fifteen minutes.

YONDU UDONTA
Remember, boy. At the end of all this, I get the stone. You cross me, we kill you all.

YONDU UDONTA
Let‟s go get „em, boys!
small plane come out from Yondu‟s main plane
GAMORA
This is a terrible plan.
PETER QUILL
Hey, you‟re the one who said you wanted to die among friends.

CORPSMAN DEY 
Nova Prime. I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers. He says Ronan‟s in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone and he‟s headed toward Xandar.
NOVA PRIME
Oh God.
CORPSMAN DEY 
It‟s a trick.
DENARIAN SAAL
He‟s a criminal.
NOVA PRIME
Did he say why we should believe him?
CORPSMAN DEY 
He said his crew just escaped from prison so he‟d have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to
help. He says that he‟s an “a-hole”. But he‟s not, and quoting him, here, “100% a dick”.
NOVA PRIME
Do you believe him?
CORPSMAN DEY 
I don‟t know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma‟am.
NOVA PRIME
I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?
CORPSMAN DEY 
Yeah.

in the Ronan‟s ship
NEBULA
A fleet approaches. They appear to be Ravagers.

YONDU UDONTA
Fire! Cover it down! Submerge!
PETER QUILL
Rocket, hurry!
All pilots, dive! They‟re beneath us!

NOVA PRIME
Evacuate the city. Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.

NEBULA
Forward thrust, now!

YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Come on!

ROCKET
Quill! Yondu! Now!
YONDU UDONTA
Hell! I‟m going down, Quill! No more games with me, boy! I‟ll see you at the end of this!
GAMORA
There are too many of them, Rocket! We‟ll never make it up there!
DENARIAN SAAL
Peter Quill. This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps. For the record, I advised against trusting you
here.
PETER QUILL
They got my “dick” message!
DENARIAN SAAL
Prove me wrong.
DRAX
Yes! Finally they success enter in Ronan‟s ship
Yes! Haha
GAMORA
We‟re just Kevin Bacon.

NEBULA
The starboard kern has been breached! We have been boarded!
RONAN
Continue our approach.
NEBULA
But the Nova Corps have engaged.
RONAN
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.
NEBULA
Seal security door! Now! Get out of my way!

ROCKET
Oh man.
NOVA PRIME
All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade. The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.
Locked in!

DRAX
I can barely see.
DRAX
When did you learn to do that?
PETER QUILL
Pretty sure the answer is “I am Groot”
GAMORA
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.
DRAX
I want you all to know that I am grateful to your acceptance after my blunders. It is pleasing to once
again have friends. You, Quill, are my friend.
PETER QUILL
Thanks.
DRAX
This dumb tree, he is my friend. And this green whore, she, too...
GAMORA
You must stop!
DRAX
Gamora, look at what you have done. You have always been weak. You stupid, traitorous...

GAMORA
Head to the flight deck. I‟ll shut down the power to the security doors.

RONAN‟S SUBORDINATE
Enough nonsense-Ravagers! Time to
die...

GAMORA
Nebula, please.

RONAN
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilot, enact immolation initiative.

DENARIAN SAAL‟S SUBORDINATE
They‟re dive-bombing the city! Denarian Saal, should we break formation?
DENARIAN SAAL
No! hold your positions.

ROCKET
Keep Ronan up there, Saal. We‟ll take care of the people down here.
DENARIAN SAAL
I can‟t believe I‟m taking orders from a hamster.

In Ronan‟s ship
KORATH
Star-Lord.
PETER QUILL
Finally.
KORATH
You thief!

KORATH
You will never make it to Ronan.

ROCKET
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.
RAVANGER / YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Come on!

DRAX
Finger to the throat means death. Metaphor. to Korath
PETER QUILL
Yeah, sorta.
Oh no.

RONAN
Xandar! You stand accused. You wretched peace treaty will not save you now. It is the tinder on
which you burn.

DENARIAN SAAL
Rocket.
ROCKET
Hold on, Saal, just... Saal crushed and die because being wedged by Ronan‟s ship
Quill, you gotta hurry. The city‟s been evacuated, but we‟re getting our asses kicked down here.
PETER QUILL
Gamora hasn‟t opened the door!

GAMORA
Nebula! Sister, help us fight Ronan. You know he‟s crazy.
NEBULA
I know you‟re both crazy.
GAMORA
No!
What the?
NEBULA
Get out!

DRAX
You did it!
RONAN
I was mistaken. I do remember you family. Their screams were pitiful. I...
ROCKET
No, Groot! You can‟t. You‟ll die. Why are you doing this? Why?
GROOT
We
are
Groot.
ROCKET
I called him an idiot.
ROCKET
You killed Groot!
RONAN
Behold! Your guardians of the galaxy. What fruit have they wrought? Only that my father and his
father shall finally know vengeance. People of Xandar, the time has come to rejoice and renounce
your paltry gods!. Your salvation it at hand.
PETER QUILL
Listen to these words. Now bring it down hard!
RONAN
surprise What are you doing?
PETER QUILL
Dance-off, bro. me and you.
Gamora. invite Gamora to dance but Gamora shook her head
Subtle. Take it back.
RONAN
What are you doing?
PETER QUILL
I‟m distracting you, you big turd blossom.
GAMORA
No! Peter! Take my hand!
RONAN
You‟re mortal! How?
PETER QUILL
You said it yourself, bitch. We‟re the Guardians of the Galaxy.
Ronan died
YONDU UDONTA
Well, well, well. Quite the light show. Ain‟t this sweet. But you got some business to attend to before
all the nookie-nookie starts.
GAMORA
Peter, you can‟t. Peter.
PETER QUILL
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu. I don‟t know who you‟re selling this to, but the only way the
universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps.
YONDU UDONTA
I may be as pretty as an angel, but I sure as hell ain‟t one. Hand it over, son.
PETER QUILL
Yondu. Do not open that Orb. You know that, right? You‟ve seen what it does to people.

YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Yeah, Quill turned out okay. It‟s probably good we didn‟t deliver him to his dad like we was hired to
do.
YONDU UDONTA
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

PETER QUILL
He is gonna pissed when he realizes I switched out the Orb on him.
GAMORA
He was gonna kill you, Peter.
PETER QUILL
I know. But he was about the only family I had.
GAMORA
No. He wasn‟t.

PETER QUILL
Why would you even know this?
CORPSMAN DEY 
When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system, so we had it checked out.
PETER QUILL
I‟m not Terran?
NOVA PRIME
You are half Terran. Your mother was of Earth. Your father, well, he‟s something very ancient we‟ve
never seen here before.
GAMORA
That could be why you were able to hold the Stone for as long as you did.
NOVA PRIME
Your friend have arrived. On behalf of the Nova Corps, we‟d like to express our profound gratitude
for your help in saving Xandar. If you will follow Denarian Dey, he has something to show you.
PETER QUILL
Thank you, Nova Prime.

GAMORA
Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them.
DRAX
Yes. Of course, Ronan was only a puppet. It‟s really Thanos I need to kill.

CORPSMAN DEY 
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible. We salvaged as much as we could.
PETER QUILL
Wow I... Thank you.
CORPSMAN DEY 
I have a family. They‟re alive because of you. Your criminal records have also been expunged.
However, I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future.
ROCKET
Question. What if I see something that I want to take, and it belongs to someone else?
CORPSMAN DEY 
You will be arrested.
ROCKET
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?
CORPSMAN DEY 
It‟s still illegal.
ROCKET
That doesn‟t follow. No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand? What are you laughing at? Why? I
can‟t have a discussion with this gentleman?
DRAX
What if someone does something irksome and I decide to remove his spine?
CORPSMAN DEY 
That‟s... That‟s actually murder. It‟s one of the worst crimes of all. So... also illegal.
PETER QUILL
They‟ll be fine, Dey. I‟m gonna keep an eye on „em.
CORPSMAN DEY 
You?
PETER QUILL
Yeah. Me.

PETER QUILL
So, what should we do next? Something good? Something bad? A bit of both?
GAMORA
We‟ll follow your lead, Star-Lord.
PETER QUILL
Bit of both.
